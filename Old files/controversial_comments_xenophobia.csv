changemyview,1bbox25,CMV: HAMAS is at fault for the tragedy in Gaza,658,Solidjakes,kucdy16,t3_1bbox25,more_beans,"I'm Irish, and as a people we have always been sympathetic to the Palestinian people because of a similar history of occupation. From our perspective here, yes Oct 7 was terrible, it was a tragedy and no civilian ever deserves to befall that fate.

But its understandable how Hamas came to power and how Oct 7 came to pass. There are entire generations of Palestinians who know nothing but Israeli occupation. Even before Oct 7, videos emerged of Israeli military responding to rock throwing with live ammunition, using white phosphorus on civillians (I have seen a video of a toddler having been hit), and detainments, Israeli citizens just walking into Palestinians homes and kicking the families living there out.

Israel have manned a strict border since the 2010s (ny exact years is rusty,  but RealLifeLore has done an excellent video on it that predates Oct 7) that has left Palestinians with far fewer rights. 

From an Irish perspective,  the North had a clear sectarian split, where Catholics were far worse off than their Protestant neighbours. Any situation split by such fickle lines as religion (or moresk using religion as an excuse when xenophobia is a more likely reason) is always going to breed violence such as the IRA and Hamas.

Videos are emerging of young children, sitting bloody and wounded in a makeshift hospital, shaking with trauma and knowing their whole family have died sobbing about how much they hate Israel, how they want them to go away. Those children's hatred is justified in my opinion, because they are too little to argue who is truly at fault. They know who killed their family, and I imagine that many members of Hamas have had experiences where they experienced trauma at the hands of Israel. You don't join a terrorist group for shits and giggles.

The IDF have proven capable of accurately targeting specific apartments in a block (like in Lebanon), so why indiscriminately bomb civillian areas? Why bomb a hospital when you can accurately target like that? 

My stance is Pro Palestine, and I would argue Israel has committed many war crimes. Like with the story of Hind Rajab, a 6 year old girl who was fleeing northern Gaza with her family (as Israel instructed people to), when her family's car was ambushed and her family killed. She was the only survivor and you can hear her calling the Red Crescent for help. The IDF blocked any help from reaching her, and when they did allow 2 Red Crescent (a humanitarian organisation) to rescue her, they bombed their ambulance. Hind died in the car, murdered by IDF soldiers. A 6 year old. This story stuck with me because  I am in the Red Cross (same organisation as the Red Crescent) and killing humanitarian workers (which we are, and we are all trained medics) is in violation of the Geneva convention. Not to mention Israels actions and threats to Rafah. You don't get to create a huge refugee camp, claim citizens will be safe and then bomb them.

The Flour Massacre also comes to mind. It is suspicious that Israel pushes the 'IDF felt threatened by advancing civillians so fired warning shots causing a stampede' story, then refuses to allow any external investigation. There is too much that doesn't add up to convince me that there was no use of cruel and disproportionate force.

IDF and their sympathisers mocking Palestinians who are suffering on social media also paints the IDF in a bad light. Raiding Palestinians homes and rifling through their underwear does not paint the IDF in a good light. I have sympathy for the victims of Oct 7 but that is as far as my sympathy extends given what I have seen in Oct 7s wake.

I have been Pro Palestine for years, and ultimately believe Israel created the perfect breeding group for Hamas through apartheid. It's hard to suggest any sort of unfallable solution because the root issue is too complex and there needs to be decades of work put into a peace process, like up North in Ireland.",40,1bbox25
changemyview,199unuw,CMV: The MAGA crowd is a cult full of hate,0,Overall-Put-1165,kihb01f,t1_kigi6bj,McBloggenstein,"It’s one thing to be gullible from his lies, but they have to already like him to be willing to fall for it all. 

The thing I wrestle with is if you’re a hardcore MAGA then he must be “speaking to you” on some level. Well, his entire messaging involves nothing but **us vs them**, manifesting in xenophobia, racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, controlling women, democrat-aphobia, etc. That’s it. I’m not saying his supporters are all of those, but more and more you get the feeling they are at least one of those. How else is it that he “speaks to you”? To me that’s not a good person.",1,kigi6bj

Otherwise who are you trying to blame with your ""conclusions""? Because you seem to be lumping in all sorts of disparate groups together, justifying your own xenophobia.

First, Israel is not Arab, and yet it's the major cause of the current conflict. It occupies and blockades Palestinians, arrests them arbitrarily, pushes them off their land within Israel proper, and steals Palestinian land within Palestine. If you think that this conflict was started over a few murders, you're dreaming. With Israelis chanting ""death to Arabs"" and hyper-nationalists in power in the Knesset, you simply can't leave Israel blameless.

Second, in the case of Boko Haram, the Nigerian government is actually responsible [for more civilian deaths](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/15/184201332/nigeria-declares-emergency-in-3-states-over-terrorism) in the conflict, with 3 states of the country under military rule for over a year. The elites of the country are incredibly rich off of oil wealth while great swaths of the country are left destitute. Also, Arabs in Nigeria are a tiny, inconsequential minority. The ruling parties are secular. Half the country is Christian, as is the President, Goodluck Jonathan.

Third, Shi'ites and Sunnis have very different political cultures and strains of extremism. Their transgressions are not alike. Plus, the major conflict in the Middle East today is *between* the Shia and the Sunni, stemming from a regional power struggle.

This isn't Arabs killing Arabs for the fun of it. It's the rising power of modernizing Shia, republican Iran clashing against Sunni, monarchist Gulf States. Both fund proxy like-minded groups in a diverse region with state borders drawn by [madmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement). This is the long-term cause for the violence in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq - everything else is details. Add in Turkey training Syrian rebels to extend its power to the south and Israel bombing Lebanon and providing medical services to Syrian rebels. This isn't some local culture of violence engulfing the region, this is regional great powers competing for land and resources. That's even if you leave out the enormity of Western intervention and the war-crime/clusterfuck that was the Iraq war.

The exploitation of migrant labor in Dubai (and other Gulf States) is not categorically different from the exploitation of migrant labor elsewhere in the world. Rural Chinese in sweatshops on the coast are migrants with few rights, Central Asians in Moscow are migrants with few rights, Latin Americans keeping US agriculture and construction and landscaping in business are migrants with few rights.

Everywhere migrants without education or possessions are dehumanized by owners of the means of production. This isn't the Arabic world, it's capitalism, baby!",7,cj6f2zd
