We did vitamin K oral drops which most countries have switched to the past few decades. Our baby has never had a needle/injection of any kind. 

Our pediatrician didn't offer covid vaccination when our baby turned 6 months old as others do.

I can't believe how many they wanted to give him at his 1 year appointment. They offered 8 vaccines, 2 of them are 3 vaccines in one (MMR and dtap) so basically a dozen vaccines in 1 day!

EDIT: Wow as we're almost at 1000 comments I want to say thanks to all the nice comments I've received I didn't think this post would blow up and I expected a higher proportion of hate. I also don't hold too much against the pro-vaxxers because I was one of you at one point in my life so I understand the brainwashing is out there and effective... although maybe the last few years should have woken you up a little bit. :)

I've worked in bad environments with sick people and whatever for years. Healthy immune system and never get sick. My kids are the same way. Colds and stuff pass through everyone in my house, and symptoms are always minor or they're over it in a day or two. 

My parents don't vaccinate or take medications as well, and they are up in age and are never sick. 

But many will line up for vaccines and do whatever they are told or they believe the fearmongering.

Furthermore, the administration of a fucking Hep B vaccine to a baby of non-hep B mothers is at best questionable if not downright unnecessary and just lining the pockets of drug manufacturers.

Lets be honest here with ourselves, everyone who has taken higher education in biology/medicine: babies have virtually no immune system, and in some studies have been shown to have cells that down-regulate their immune system as an artifact thought to slowly disappear overtime (2-3 months after birth) as the baby is no longer in the mother and no longer has a reason to attenuate its immune system that may otherwise attack whatever mom is supplying the baby.

I think a slower administration of certain vaccines would make sense rather than to inject all of the above into a new born, pending certain circumstances.

However, most people are stupid and can't stay isolated for 2-3 months to allow their child to properly develop and expose themselves and their child to all of the above. So really the newborn vaccine seems to be a two factor principle: people are stupid and we need to line the pockets of big pharma.",1,17iatd7

You’re also forgetting how much people HATED trump because they’d been gaslit for 4 fucking years.

I would assume, inflation has been caused globally by lockdowns, supply shortages and redundancies in major industries that have needed a quick staff turn around to nominal level now that covid is self manageable. 

Cost of living increases have been happening as we’re at the tail end of a 12 year market cycle, I think still we’re just reeling from the 2008 financial crash but the pandemic caused a LOT of people to just start trading because they had nothing else to lose when money was regularly being provided, and to stagger a financial depression during covid they printed money to attempt stagflation which has made it 10X worse, especially considering Russia attacking Ukraine which is causing oil and gas shortages across Europe and later food shortages, but Russia knew this would be an opportune time to strike. also I should mention the Chinese housing market crisis, which currently is going wildly out of control.

Ehm, well you are going overboard here, aren't you? Russia never gave them such choice, who was threatening to eliminate them? 


It's same story as with Kosovo. Russia sent troops to Crimea, referendum was hosted, they decided to stick with Russia. 


Then Donbass region stood up to the overthrown goverment and decided to fight it. Obviously with the backing and pushing of Russia, but nevertheless it wouldn't happen if local authorities and at least some people were against new government, new policy and what it could mean for them.


>The soldiers of the Russian Federation have murdered, raped, plundered and pillaged.


Have you seen what Azov soldiers did to their own ukranian, but russian speaking people? Have you seen what Ukranian forces did to captured soldiers?


It's war, government can't control every soldier, what important is if the commands from above tell you to do and in this case even when prisoners were recruited to go to war they were warned that any kind of plundering will be punished by death.


Russia wanted to come in with no ill intentions towards people, but to overthrow government and make sure the weapons that were loaded into ukraine were controlled by them.

You got baited hard by the propoganda. That's what they are trying to sow in the people. Fear of gone mad terrorist Russia, so that everyone would hate the state.



Estonia, Lithuania are already in NATO and have rocket complexes deployed on their territory, why would Russia attack them?

I suggest you perhaps might go back to the agreement that NATO wouldn’t expand its borders. So back in late 90s discussions of discussions with Ukraine were considered. Early to mid 00s Biden had begun talking about doing things for Ukraine, bu 2012-2014 the Obama administration was fully invested in Ukraine being vetted for NATO. They helped secure their “democratically elected leaders” even though we have talks suggested who we wanted as a leader… so when that “election” and totally not a coup designed by the US as they do in every country in “turmoil” *gee I wonder how the turmoil started… CIAs bread and butter* well they installed their leader. Hunter Biden is attached to garner political ties for the agenda to weaponized Ukraine.

All the while Hillary (Obama’s sec of state at the time) is running for office, and guess what the agenda is? Trump is Russia puppet!… few years later we find out Hillary paid for the damn fake dossier from Dechanko… so that would violate the FISA process of spying on Americans, especially those who are presidential candidates. Huge problem. That’s like mega-corruption actions right there… and then after Trump Biden steals the election cause they had no choice because their agenda, let me remind you, was Ukraine oriented. It sped up those plans. 

If Covid came from China (border Russia) and Russia accuses Ukraine of Bio weapons. Maybe Ukraine’s job was to also get Russia to doubt China too. That’s just my spin to it. Moving forward, Biden literally stumbles into office amidst election fraud claims that they refused to investigate, and then somehow the conclusion from the Biden regime setting Ukraine up for this entire event thag we are seeing now. Don’t believe me? Read Biden’s god damn speeches he gave in Ukraine. The visionary fucked us all, what’s the most hilarious aspect is one of his tenets he goes off about democracy and shit is to get Ukraine energy indecent… where was Hunter working again? Burisma energy? And what are they notorious for? Gouging energy prices against Ukrainians? Energy costs have been more than rent for a long while for Ukraine.

You believe propaganda and it’s awful how much you fail to attach recorded history towards a opinion so riddled with flaws.

Also the biolabs that were installed  under Obama approved in 2012 and we denied the existence of Biolabs under Biden? He must have forgotten or that’s his endgame with perhaps even faking dementia. Whatever we’re living it’s fucking scary to have a president with Alzheimer’s. You can even see the symptoms clear as day. The hands up not knowing what to do, shaking hands with people who aren’t there, the change in his gait, the cluelessness, the rage as sun downing starts to hit.

He’s a puppet. And the CIA and FBI, are corrupted under Obama. Clearly with the whistleblowers now that’s clear that so many went to back up the whistleblower, 30 agents. They all don’t believe in upper leadership and even back up the claims of the corruption. So seriously when you wanna drop back down into reality I’d LOVE it.",-21,iqra8pb

Here's Joe Biden's speech in Ukraine in 2009

Fav quote

>And I would note parenthetically, **can you name me a place where democracy has flourished where the** **economic system has failed?**  Mature democracies survive because they develop institutions such as a free press, a **truly independent court system**, an **effective legislature** \-- all of which serve as a check on the corruption that fuels the cynicism and limits growth in any country, including yours.  And in a democracy, **compromise is not a sign of weakness;** it is evidence of strength.

Yea Joe Biden is really well known for compromise. Also look at the Hunter Biden scandal, the DOJ and everything else about our lovely democracy that Joe Biden is trying to show Ukraine what it's missing out on.

Here's Joe Biden's second speech in Ukraine 2015

Chef's kiss here bro

>But in addition, you also have a battle, a **historic battle against corruption.**  Ukraine cannot afford for the people to lose hope again.  The only thing worse than having no hope at all is having hopes rise and see them dashed repeatedly on the shoals of corruption.  
  
And if the people resign themselves to exploitation and corruption for fear of losing whatever little they have left, that would be the death knell for Ukrainian democracy.  We’ve taken so many critical steps already.  But all of you know there’s more to do to finish this race.  Not enough has been done yet.   
  
As the Prime Minister and the President heard me often say, I never tell another man or another nation or another woman what’s in their interest.  **But I can tell you, you cannot name me a single democracy in the world where the cancer of corruption is prevalent.**  You cannot name me one.  They are thoroughly inconsistent.  A**nd it’s not enough to set up a new anti-corruption bureau** and establish a **special prosecutor fighting corruption**.  **The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.  The judiciary should be overhauled.  The energy sector needs to be competitive**, ruled by market principles -- **not sweetheart deals.  It’s not enough to push through laws to increase transparency with regard to official sources of income.  Senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities.**  Every other democracy in the world -- that system pertains. 

Except American and Joe Biden. Was it a sweetheart deal for Hunter to sit on the board of Burisma with no qualifications to anything energy related?

Did they get energy indepdence or did Ukraine suffer heavily to the costly energy market left behind by people like Hunter.

Considering Joe Biden has been a strong proponent to Ukraine, how did he fuck everything up so wonderfully for Ukraine AND America? Or is war the preferred position to be when you've been pushing to be president for almost 40 years only to botch it as soon as you come out the gate.

He was VP for god's sake - also funny enough mentioned in the 2015 speech Obama was talking to Putin at the same time. Weird right? It's like nothing they did actually mattered. It wasn't until Trump where Russia stopped it's aggression.

Under Obama he took Crimea. Under Bush Putin invaded Georgia.

>In early March 2008, Abkhazia and South Ossetia submitted formal requests for their recognition to Russia's parliament shortly after the West's recognition of Kosovo which Russia had been resisting. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador to NATO, hinted that Georgia's aspiration to become a NATO member would cause Russia to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\[82\] The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it called on the President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.\[

So they KNOW that any NATO expansion provokes Russia's hand. There has already been US meddling in Ukrainian elections. This should have been seen as an inevitability. Not to mention that Obama talked to Putin 

>The United States calls on Russia to de-escalate tensions by withdrawing its forces back to bases in Crimea and to refrain from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine. **We have consistently said that we recognize Russia’s deep historic and cultural ties to Ukraine and the need to protect the rights of ethnic Russian and minority populations within Ukraine.**  The Ukrainian government has made clear its commitment to protect the rights of all Ukrainians and to abide by Ukraine’s international commitments, and we will continue to urge them to do so.

So there again, a reorganization of Russian motivations and then it goes on to say that Obama says Ukraine wants Democracy, and that they will protect Ukranian rights, essentially saying ""don't worry bro we got this"" but that's not how it reads to Russia when the armed conflict lasted years and there was no mercy to those in the separatist regions from being bombed for years. 

What more do you want man?

Obama and Biden have been ALL OVER this conflict and have done nothing but lie to Putin about their intentions and carry on with their plan to aggravate and cause a conflict for the sake of preserving and spreading their version of democracy - which doesn't seem to agree with the other Ukrainians. So essentially we forced a civil war, called it some other type of conflict, backed the side willing to fight Russia and provoke a proxy war, implemented the arms trades and deals and money flowing from Ukraine to US until Biden became president and then the US is now feeding Ukraine all because?... We want to help Ukraine the country infamous for corruption? Really? You see nothing wrong with any of this.",0,iqrtv2i

>You're leagues better at delivering bullshit conservative opinions than anyone I've seen in years. 

Do you typically insult people when you ask them questions? I'd assume you haven't met anyone in years because most people can't tolerate people like yourself.

Maintaining the mocking rhetoric must be tough for you, clearly you seemed to struggle to even show a modicum of decorum to a question you asked. 

How am I supposed to summarize global affairs and hypothetical scenarios and make it iron clad? You literally gave me no room to work with reasonably, but I think you knew that. I wasn't going to concede, because I love what I do. 

Here's why we are in Ukraine by the way straight from the VPs mouth. 

>“So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia,” she continued. “Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that’s wrong, and it goes against everything that we stand for.”

I couldn't have said it better myself... This is Biden's pick. Biden's super lucid non-dementia ridden brain.

You're criticisms mean nothing, because, unlike you... I don't make hasty generalizations about someone. I take criticisms as an opportunity to research. It's fun, you should try it.

I also love how your stance has no good outcome for Trump. Let's see... If Trump puts forward good faith toward Putin... = Russian sympathizer. Trump puts up a fight = Warmonger. Because when Trump was running they were saying ""He's gonna cause WWIII ahhh!"" and then what do you know? Biden gets in office and it's ""We're gonna start WWIII, I'm gonna crash the economy and then pick a fight with Russia, by backing the border country of an enemy we've only accused our political competition of colluding with!""

Also Stormy Daniels ended up being a hoax...

If you do not realize the lack of good faith from your own argument then I concede. You clearly were going to win your own debate, congrats. You are the master of your world, your close minded, narrow, ignorant world.. Now let me go back to reading more speeches from 2009, 2015, about how Biden was going to fix everything in Ukraine, only to get into the position of power to do something about it, and watch it fall to shit in his hand. Ironically, being the boogeyman for almost a century, somehow Russia is a formidable enemy, but yet only Joe Biden could go toe to toe with him.

Why don't you actually take a swing of saying something of substance. I mean one thing is for certain, if anyone would have listened to Trump, Germany wouldn't be in the energy crisis, and complete mercy of Russian energy... which was warned about. Look whos laughing now. You're talking points are all speculative and conjecture anyways. This whole exercise was to talk about how Trump would have handled Russia. It's clear that you don't really know what Trump did. Just how the media perceives him. 

Was that too much? Geez I'd hate to overburden your fragile mind. Oh no. He's gonna make fun of me again I can just tell. Please make it stop! Before he says tries more liberal talking points without any real meaningful evidence!

Maybe instead of talking about the things Trump hypothetically could have done, or what Trump did do wrong in your eyes, let's talk about what Biden has done right? Got anything for that? I sure done. The days he manages to walk away from the podium and not get lost seems like a win to me. I mean at least Trump has his motor skills and mental acuity. For reference, he's catching hats and sharpies and signing them and throwing them back. Think Biden could do the same? ""why does that matter"" Well they did try to article 25 Trump over water on a tie and going down a ramp fast... so what's with the double standards? Or do we pretend to not notice them when it's not at Trump's expense?",0,iqxghbo

changemyview,17yrbm5,"CMV: People who use the word ""herstory"" are fucking idiots.",70,RealFee1405,k9w2lch,t3_17yrbm5,gate18,"I love the word!

History has been told from a male point of view and the word ""herstory"" has originated as a critique to that. It was coined by Robin Morgan in 1968.

Without mixing sexism or politics, a lot of people hate the evolution of language, they hate play on words, and they think others that don't adhere to the ""standard"" are ""fucking stupid"". There are old woman, at least in United Kingdom, who write letters to different organizations when they see language not used the way it's supposed to.

So, in a way, surely you are a ""fucking idiot"" to someone else for the way you use language. **I know, you think that your objections are valid unlike those old hags**

> Using ""herstory"" is based on ignorance and stupidity and false presumptions about etymology that could easily be reversed by a Google search

Secondly, feminists (a bunch of people with a huge range of interests) aren't ignorant, **though by now even stupid people can google search**, they know what you know. So it's not what you think but it's a play on words to **highlight the actual fact** that history is written by men (and the powerful)

As with many slogans, They want you to think. In my opinion, even your rant (though it doesn't look like it) is positive. 50 people might agree with you and 1 might start to think about the way history is written.

At the end of the day, words are made up. Why was the word ""history"" taken from France? It could have been taken by anywhere else and no one would give a shit today. But surely back then, some person, said ""why should we take words from the French, which not ...""

Making up words that make people talk about the issue is genius - even if they butcher the topic at hand

Black Lives Matter vs stop killing black people. A lot of racists came of out the woodworks. A lot of people willingly prevented themselves from going beyond the slogan...  ""I've been saying it but no one believed me, Blacks are hateful. Now look, only black lives matter""

If instead they just said ""history from a woman's perspective"" - meh. 

I'm sure they were using that even before 1968. ""A room of one's own? Meh, just some women writing from a woman's perspective, they just can't stop playing the victim, they don't realize how good they have it. You know we have 10 men sleeping in the same room and she writes about a woman needing a room of her own and £500, the fucking cheek""

I think that plenty of men (not ALL men, let’s be clear) like to claim that women comedians are not funny when in fact, the reason they’re not laughing is because they’re already annoyed that a woman is in that position. Add to the fact that a woman comedian might make a joke about “men” the same way men comedians joke about “women,” so when these men find out that they’re the butt of the joke, they claim that the comedian is “not funny.”

It’s so interesting when you go on any woman comedian’s Instagram and you look at the comments. More than half of them are men saying things like “painfully unfunny.” Because they’re not trying to actually give these comedians a chance to make them laugh, they’re more interested in expressing hate and discouraging the woman from continuing to do comedy because they feel irritated by her.

The idea that white males are hated is not one without merit.  For many years there was a general belief that it's ok to ""punch up"" when attacking a different group and white males have been viewed as having the best quality lives.  
  
There is certainly some truth to that but it's also worth noting that some groups have actually outperformed them but don't have the same numbers.  What started shifting the opinion of many people in that camp was when laws started being put in place to push for equity.  
  
While this is a nice idea, you end up with a situation where a group that has been denigrated for years, is also receiving less benefits than other groups in the hope of creating equity.  Average white men suffered under the 2008 crash and under economic turmoil and there has been a lot of anger that has developed in those communities as they feel they're suffering but being told their actually privileged.

According to the internetz, ""64.1% of the U.S. adult population was white alone, and 12% was Black or African American alone"" -- so if you're going for absolute, which is likely what you would then see portrayed in the media -- then that would be one factor.

As I have heard said, a black trans person going between male <-> female is dealing with being caught between ""the most feared"" demographic and ""the most dismissed"" -- so if you mean ""most hated"" in terms of individuals then I think you're likely right (some people hate what they fear, and generally they don't fear white males as much).

Also, people hate that of which they are envious. And, according to the same internetz ""white people own 86% of wealth in the United States"" -- and generally I'd assume that men hold more wealth than women (or at least *are perceived* to hold the wealth).  So sure, people are gonna hate on that which they envy.

And your point about would somebody change their racial makeup seems kinda irrelevant. ""Would you like to have lots of power and wealth and be part of the majority and be more hated, or would you rather be part of a (unspecified) minority that has less power and wealth and be less hated?""

When I tell other people about it, they frequently try to convince me that the explicitly racist threats I received aren’t racist OR that I need to consider and empathize with the socioeconomic factors that would lead to someone having so much violent hate for white men.

Or I have ppl coming out of the woodwork to tell me ‘that isn’t racism’ because a certain subset of ppl really like to enforce a highly specific definition of racism ONLY when the victim is white and the aggressor is not.

IMO white ppl aren’t distinct in the quantity of racism they have directed at them.

Of course all of this was predictable when we legislated how private people ought to behave, giving them a source of resentment to fight against.  We should have left all private discrimination legal, so the bigots had nothing to blame but themselves.  Now they can easily find examples of unfairness, enabled by law, that justify that resentment.  For example, how public schools now let many disciplinary violations pass unpunished because of claims of racism, when many have seen first hand that the differences in white/black punishment rates were tightly aligned with differences in white/black behavior, and claims of bias were largely unfounded (at least in my mid Atlantic city).  Unequal outcomes in school is not due to teachers' treating kids unequally, but due to different behavior for basically the same treatment.

From our perspective here, yes Oct 7 was terrible, it was a tragedy and no civilian ever deserves to befall that fate.

But its understandable how Hamas came to power and how Oct 7 came to pass. There are entire generations of Palestinians who know nothing but Israeli occupation. Even before Oct 7, videos emerged of Israeli military responding to rock throwing with live ammunition, using white phosphorus on civillians (I have seen a video of a toddler having been hit), and detainments, Israeli citizens just walking into Palestinians homes and kicking the families living there out.

Israel have manned a strict border since the 2010s (ny exact years is rusty,  but RealLifeLore has done an excellent video on it that predates Oct 7) that has left Palestinians with far fewer rights. 

From an Irish perspective,  the North had a clear sectarian split, where Catholics were far worse off than their Protestant neighbours. Any situation split by such fickle lines as religion (or moresk using religion as an excuse when xenophobia is a more likely reason) is always going to breed violence such as the IRA and Hamas.

Videos are emerging of young children, sitting bloody and wounded in a makeshift hospital, shaking with trauma and knowing their whole family have died sobbing about how much they hate Israel, how they want them to go away. Those children's hatred is justified in my opinion, because they are too little to argue who is truly at fault. They know who killed their family, and I imagine that many members of Hamas have had experiences where they experienced trauma at the hands of Israel. You don't join a terrorist group for shits and giggles.

The IDF have proven capable of accurately targeting specific apartments in a block (like in Lebanon), so why indiscriminately bomb civillian areas? Why bomb a hospital when you can accurately target like that? 

My stance is Pro Palestine, and I would argue Israel has committed many war crimes. Like with the story of Hind Rajab, a 6 year old girl who was fleeing northern Gaza with her family (as Israel instructed people to), when her family's car was ambushed and her family killed. She was the only survivor and you can hear her calling the Red Crescent for help. The IDF blocked any help from reaching her, and when they did allow 2 Red Crescent (a humanitarian organisation) to rescue her, they bombed their ambulance. Hind died in the car, murdered by IDF soldiers. A 6 year old. This story stuck with me because  I am in the Red Cross (same organisation as the Red Crescent) and killing humanitarian workers (which we are, and we are all trained medics) is in violation of the Geneva convention. Not to mention Israels actions and threats to Rafah. You don't get to create a huge refugee camp, claim citizens will be safe and then bomb them.

The Flour Massacre also comes to mind. It is suspicious that Israel pushes the 'IDF felt threatened by advancing civillians so fired warning shots causing a stampede' story, then refuses to allow any external investigation. There is too much that doesn't add up to convince me that there was no use of cruel and disproportionate force.

IDF and their sympathisers mocking Palestinians who are suffering on social media also paints the IDF in a bad light. Raiding Palestinians homes and rifling through their underwear does not paint the IDF in a good light. I have sympathy for the victims of Oct 7 but that is as far as my sympathy extends given what I have seen in Oct 7s wake.

I have been Pro Palestine for years, and ultimately believe Israel created the perfect breeding group for Hamas through apartheid. It's hard to suggest any sort of unfallable solution because the root issue is too complex and there needs to be decades of work put into a peace process, like up North in Ireland.",41,1bbox25
changemyview,1bbox25,CMV: HAMAS is at fault for the tragedy in Gaza,655,Solidjakes,kuaxb44,t3_1bbox25,Mountain-Resource656,"Point of order: It is incredibly unlikely that either side is wholly at fault

>> Is it not rational to assign responsibility during the leadership shift in 2007?

However, more to the point, about 18 years ago, Hamas was elected with (iirc) 44% of the vote, gaining only a little over half of their seats in government- they did *not* get elected by a majority and become dictatorial rulers

They then instigated a military coup, ousted all other parties (making them illegal), banned any subsequent elections, and continue to this day to violently oppress other political groups. Also, again, this was 18 years ago. The average age in Gaza is 18. Half weren’t even alive then, and of that, it’s not like 1 year olds could vote. I once did some (somewhat shaky) math to try and figure out who was even alive and 18+ years old at the time to estimate what percentage of the modern population voted for Hamas and it came out to something like 7%

Of course, you’re blaming *Hamas,* which does not mean Palestine as a whole, but you mentioned them as if they were a legitimate governing body, which they’re not, and it’s important to recognize that, because that feeds into my next point: If you kidnap my hypothetical sister, it’s hard to say you’re at fault if I kill yours as a response if she’s uninvolved

Of course, *are* Palestinians uninvolved? Perhaps they coulda risen up to overthrow Hamas. Perhaps some of them- despite not voting for Hamas- still support them and cheer on their killings of Israeli people

But lemme ask you this: Say there’s an innocent Palestinian kid and his innocent brother, and Israel bombs his house (over half their bombs are indiscriminate, it would seem) and they kill his brother

Of course it’s reasonable for him to then hate Israel as a whole! But let’s say he sees some videos of some Israeli people cheering on Israel’s military and explicitly saying they’re glad Palestinians are dying- I’ve seen those, myself. Let’s say he joins Hamas to protect people like his brother and launches a bomb indiscriminately at an Israeli city, saying “well *some* of their people cheered for their military killing my brother. The Israeli people could have not even risen up but just *voted* differently. So therefore all Israeli citizens are valid targets.”

Now obviously that’s bogus. He’d still be in the wrong for that. It doesn’t matter if some (or most) Israeli citizens voted for their current administration, it doesn’t matter if some support their military or if some cheer for the carnage or want more of it, that does not mean that they’re valid targets, and it doesn’t mean that Israel is responsible for that attack

So apply that same logic, but swap our the actors. An Israeli sees innocent Israelis- maybe even their family- being attacked and killed, and they respond by becoming a politician or a military person and they order the bombing of- or carry out orders for the bombing of- random buildings in Gaza, saying how the Palestinians there were at fault for it. That’s bogus logic.

Same as saying “oh, they’re using human shields,” which I think you might be thinking of so I wanna tackle that one, too. If a bank robber takes some folks hostage, you don’t utterly ignore the hostages and just fire through them to hit the bank robber, you go at it more carefully. If you *do* shoot through a hostage to kill a robber, you can hardly claim to be utterly guiltless- especially when there are other ways of ending the hostilities. Which there are, in this case; though that’s another conversation",11,1bbox25

Never mind (By Israel I mean the govt and/or IDF): Israel helped Hamas via funding. Israel helped Hamas get elected (how much is up for debate as far as i'm aware). Israel has mistreated Palestinians long before Hamas became what it is now (or was). Israel continues to as a matter of policy and act, mistreat, detain (w/o charges and such), abuse, etc. Palestinians in the West Bank. On and on it goes.   


You may have a point about the leadership shift, but none of this would have gotten to this point if Israeli policy and actions had not been what they have been. I'm not talking about simply national security/safety. I'm talking about going beyond most standards of reasonableness and the aforementioned not at all full list of things Israel has done. They could have taken a completely different path, one less hostile to Palestinians as a whole; case in point, instead of backing and/or supporting Hamas as they did (have?), they could have worked with PLO, et al. (even if they were corrupt, etc.) or the UN to foster stability, less corruption, and so on.   


In short, as much as Hamas has done shit, there have way more times that Israel could have taken a different, less antagonistic, or nationalistic, or hard right, or whatever you wish to call it...approach.

The whole Palestinian identity is a recent concept and even the ""Palestinian"" name is actually a short version of ""Palestinian Arabs"", which opposed to ""Palestinian Jews"" back at the start of the 20th century. The Arabs resettled in the area with the Ottoman conquest, taking nomads from Syria and the Middle East, while the Jews started their migration at the end of the 18th century.

Without taking into account ancient history, which would be silly, we know that in 1939 there were about 600k Jews and 1,3 mil Muslims in Palestine, all of which could trace their heritage at best one century earlier.

There is no proof to claim that Palestinian Arabs had a stronger claim over Palestine than the Jews, which is exactly why the British split their Mandate for Palestine in two and gave each side a part of it, because it was pretty clear that without the British to enforce order the Jews would have been purged out of the area, just as happened in every other MENA country after the departure of the colonialists.

The reason we have this constant war now is because the Islamics could not accept to only have half of the country and immediatly attacked the newborn state of Israel, retaking the Cisjordan. Even the Gaza strip is in the current state not because of Israel conquest, but because Egypt decided to drop it after the Kippur war.

Add to this that Palestinians teach even their children to stab and kidnap Jewish civilians in the streets and you get fully well why they don't deserve another two-state solution - they couldn't even accept the first one and they're only going to make a terrorist state out of whatever land you grant them. Even the PLO claims that the Palestinian state is only a first step for them - they plan to eradicate the Jews altogether from the area.

And in the last twenty years missiles have ALWAYS flew from Gaza toward Israel. Always, with the Palestinian defence force doing nothing to fight or stop Hamas while the PA chose to teach anti-semitic curricula in UNRWA schools. And UNRWA itself bears a lot of responsibility for this situation because we wouldn't have a radicalized population if its officers had actually fixed the school curriculum to democratic standards rather than glorifying the intifadas and enflame hate.

Bottom line, you just can't award this level of violence with a country, it's like saying that wars for conquest are okay to do. And you certainly can't do so to replace the only democratic country in the Middle East with another fundamentalist Islamic state.",34,kubzqz6

The history of the Jewish people is just thousands of years of genocide and persecution and homelessness. While it certainly doesn’t justify the wild amount of violence and cruelty that the Israeli government inflicts on Palestine, I do think it explains it. 

I think that as a whole a lot of Jewish people have the mindset of “enough is enough. We have a home now and we literally stoop to any level to keep it; we will never be victims again.”

The fact is that there literally was no safe place for Jews in Europe in the WW2 period. One of the main things that started the genocide was the refusal of western nations to take in the Jewish people Hitler was expelling. And like you said there was a mass amount of antisemitism both normalized in the populace and encouraged by government. No one likes Jews, it is always Jewish peoples fault. 

Sociologist Kathleen Blee even noted in her work on extreme hate groups that all of them, regardless of the type of hate group, shared a vehement and conspiratorial antisemitism that she called foundational to the modern hate group. They might hate black people and thats why they exist, but they don’t think that black americans are surreptitiously running the world. That honor always goes to Jews. 

Like I said, I agree with you pretty much entirely, but I don’t think that the idea that Jewish people had no safe place to go is “ridiculous”. The Atlantic just released an article a couple days ago detailing how decades of Jewish peace in America are coming to end.

First let's establish Disney's real biggest problem

They have made production costs and marketing costs so high that unless something is a mega Blockbuster they're going to lose money on it and even if it is a mega blockbuster they might still not beat the rate of capital for the amount they sink into it

So no matter what else we say any negative performance could effectively be blamed on that whether or not that is the case That's just bad business

Now here are the three other sides to this though

First what was Disney's core audience 

It was the family-friendly with kids they are definitely no longer trying to cater to that group and while normally taking political stances doesn't hurt companies or help them That's only if it doesn't alienate their target patrons (generally whatever you gain from one thing costs you the other) 

So in that regard going woke should actually do some damage

However the second issue actually the more important issue 

The second reason this might be bad for Disney is not adding"" woke"" elements doesn't make up for if another aspect of the quality is diminished

If you make a bad character throwing on a coat of ""woke"" paint is not going to help 

If you skimp on the marketing it does not matter if the films ""woke"" or not (I have heard that's what the problem with Lost world was but I have not verified) 

That is actually a major concern whenever anyone's putting a lot of focus on diversity It shouldn't ever be a selling point because all of the other selling points should be the selling point

Third there should not actually be a reward to a lot of this stuff but there is going to be costs

So as addressed in the first point normally when you do political stuff The audience gain loss cancels out but crucially if you are hiring people to figure out how to do this that is an additional cost The actual logistics of making something purposely""woke"" does have some expenses and any of the real social points they would actually get from any of this get canceled out by the fact that they edit the stuff for overseas Which they then have to pay to edit it for overseas

Theyre more interested in being super preachy, and a lot of their ideas are reductive. You know what was a woke movie that people love? Zootopia. You know what’s woke that people hate? Star Wars and Rachel Ziegler’s comments on Snow White.

changemyview,1999c5f,"CMV: Disney is not losing money over being ""woke""",2,Enbie-or-Trans,kw3izxk,t3_1999c5f,slutpriest,"It goes deeper than Disney. DEI changes throughout companies are being perpetuated by the people holding all the bags and giving money out.(Blackrock being an example) If you don't do or say certain things, you will not get funding. If you dont hit certain quotas, you will not get funding. It's that simple.

Most regular people don't understand how deep it goes, unless you see behind the curtain on how most financial and investments work. Even with movies. Disney doesn't drop 300 million of their own money on a movie. They get investors. It's kinda like a car payment. You don't drop 30k on a new car, even if you have the money. You finance it.

The one thing I don't think people on the outside understand is really how buddy-buddy hand in hand these corporations are. And when things don't go as planned, it's almost sickening how quickly they turn on each other and cancel projects and IPs.

Another note: touching on the ""go woke get broke"" note that alot of people don't seem to understand. Alot of the fans don't care if there's a white guy, black guy, lesbian female alien or anything in these roles, unless it's turned up to 100, or, unless it goes against the lore of a preset, non invented IP. That's where alot of the problem lies.

Just a few examples

New LoTR show? Bomb. It's Galadriel acting like she's Celaena Sardothien. No other elf (coughs, Legolas, cough) on the entire show was nearly as good as her. She put the guys down for no reason. People don't like that.

She-hulk? Bomb. They made the character a bitch for absolutely no reason. And made Bruce look like a bitch for trying to help here. Completely unnecessary way to make a strong female lead.There's plenty of shows I love with strong female leads that don't act like they're superior to the opposite sex and/or everyone around them.

Star wars? Oh god, look what they did to my boy Luke. How could they? Even Mark Hamil was furious. I don't have a problem with daisy ridley, but the fact that she just ""has powers"" and is a ""Mary sue"" is because it disrespected the entire lore of the franchise. Luke, the CHOSEN ONE, trained for his powers in every movie leading up to RoTJ.

Don't even get me started on the Witcher. Henry felt the same way, which is why he left the show.

I could go on, but you get the gist. 

The point is that the regular fans of these older IPs don't like forced diversity or real life politics spilling into our TV shows, movies, and video games. We watch and play these to escape reality. We know when it's forced and when it's not.

The Hollywood consultants and new age screen writers that are putting forced diversity into these things are so vindictive and passively hateful and pushy about it aswell, which is turning a lot of the fan base off. It's happening too much, too quickly and is being done with older IPs. The long time fans that dislike this stuff just want them to make their own IPs and stop destroying theirs, trying to wring as much money out of a dying/undying franchise as they can.

I mean, what new IP have you seen recently that nails all the diversity quotas and shoots to success with all audiences? I'll wait. 

I hope this kinda answers your question, I know alot of people commenting got distracted by the ""don't say gay"" thing or whatever, but being on neither side of the political spectrum I thought I'd offer what a neutral party sees.

As you acknowledge, progressives already hate Disney because they are a big corporation. They aren't likely to change because Disney is pretending to care about social causes. 

So let's break down America. Let's assume left and right are relatively equal. So you have the 80% of normal people who don't care one way or the other. They don't protest. They probably vote, but at the end of the day, it's America, sometimes your guy wins, sometimes it's the other guy. They're not boycotting anything, ever.

Then you have the remaining 20%. The hardcore people. They get on Reddit, or x, or whatever. They complain. They hate Trump, or Biden. Or Obama. Or whatever. The progressive ones among them hate Disney, and Amazon, and Walmart and Big Oil. The Conservative ones hate Disney and whatever else. But the thing about these 20% is while they might all swear up and down that they are boycotting x, y, or, z: they aren't. They are just virtue signalling how great they are. It's a performance.

Then in that 20%, you have a small faction who we can call the real deal. I don't know what the percentage would be for them, but I do know it's fairly small. When they say they aren't giving money to Disney, they mean it. As you mentioned, the progressives are already doing that. And they aren't going to be won back by hollow gestures from big evil corporations. Then you have the conservative ones, who will actually boycott Disney and stick to it. So you already lost the left-wing-boycotters; now you've lost the right wing ones, too. 

Again, what are the numbers? It's impossible to say, because those 20% of fakes will swear up and down. And because media is currently changing (more streaming services, less theatre movies) it's hard to work out just what number of subscribers, or potential subscribers  to Disney+ have been lost, but it's certainly not zero.

The other thing to note is that while disney may not lose much income, they may lose share value by being involved in yet another controversy. And that's really what matters, even more than profit.",1,1999c5f

I like them because they are well written shows that treat all the characters fairly regardless of gender. The female characters are strong in their own right without having to make the men in the shows weak or incompetent to lift the female leads up. 

Disney and a lot of other companies do the opposite of this and basically follows a flow chart. They start with a female Mary sue lead then look at the supporting characters. Is that character male or female, if male is that character white or a person of color, if white he’s either evil or incompetent and there for jokes, if a POC is he black or some other non-white race? If black that male is the absolute most perfect morally righteous savior a person could ever have, If non black they’re morally gray at worst but always portrayed as better then then evil/stupid white guy. Back to the beginning of the chart, if female is this character initially portrayed as good or evil, if good she’s always good and morally right her biggest challenge is getting herself and others to accept how awesome and perfect she is, if bad in the end it’s revealed that she’s actually good/morally gray but trying to do the right thing and she’s just been in some way manipulated by some man/society to do the bad things she did and those people are the real villain. 

There’s nothing wrong with having diversity or a strong female lead but don’t make put one group down to make another look artificially better. That’s the reason I love arcane/blue eyed samurai but hate the captain marvel movie. 

Although not Disney a good movie that demonstrates this point is birdbox. A movie that centers around the characters evading monster that causes anyone to look at it to commit suicide UNLESS that’s person was already clinically insane, those who are already crazy don’t kill themselves but try to force others to look at the monster. Something that I noticed that none of my friends seemed to is that every single one of these “insane” people except for one was a white man, and the last one was a white woman who attacked with a group of white men. I believe the only white man shown in the whole movie who wasn’t already affected by the monster was the owner of the house the group of survivors stayed at during the beginning of the movie but he was portrayed as a huge asshole almost every single even he was in. 

Idk I’ve kind of gone off on a tangent but I do definitely believe Disney is leaning towards a progressive bias idk the last time I saw one of their movies that wasn’t just woman perfect, man bad. Do I think that’s the only reason they’re losing money no, they’re just making bad movies, but they might have a better chance at making good movies if they just balanced all the characters instead of making some always righteous and perfect and always shitting on other just based off their sex + skin color. It doesn’t necessarily mean the movie will be ass, but 99% of the time if I start watching a movie and 15 minutes in I start noticing all the characters follow the flowchart I laid out above I always hate the movie but feel free to give me some recomendations that prove me wrong",0,1999c5f

Here someone is probably projecting we need to increase ticket sales to adolescent girls. Which means creating more female role models who aren't as sexualized as scar jo, so millennial parents will want their girls to look up to them.

So much of the problem with ""woke"" pandering is it's done for the sake of doing it, with little care given to the quality of the story. Not that they do an amazing job at non-woke stories, but a story being woke is a good indication their focus on the woke stuff means they neglected the movie in other areas.

I'm pretty vehemently anti-woke but even I was cool with Black Ariel. Mermaids are mythical creatures from the make-believe nation of Atlantis. All bets are off. Yes, she was explicitly stated to have pale skin in the original short story, but that is FAR from the biggest artistic liberty that Disney took with the source material. Same goes for Black Tinkerbell. Tink doesn't even canonically have a skin color in the source material. She was originally portrayed on-stage as a bright point of light that communicated in wind-chime noises.

I think the bigger issue for most people, especially parents, is the insertion of LGBT+ content (Lightyear) or explicit references to sexual topics (Turning Red) into Pixar movies.

That misplaced focus is contributing to unreconciliable situations and behaviors for characters they are writing.

That's the criticism, they are storytelling backwards. They first check the boxes for whatever inclusive message they are trying to push, then they do a pass so the character's traits and presentation couldn't possibly be perceived as negative in pretty much any way, then they try to build a world around them. This results in completely unrelatable characters and unrelatable, meaningless choices the character has to make due to all of these contrived puppet strings.

Captain Marvel is a great example. They made her so strong without any weaknesses and that resulted in having completely unsatisfactory storytelling for her character arc. They wanted to write a strong female character that would save the day and who was stronger than all the boys and who doesn't need help from anyone. Alright, mission accomplished, but now how are you going to write your way out of it? You can't, and that immense plot armor rooted in the desire to write a ""woke"" character, one that aligns with modern Western rhetoric of woman empowerment, is the cause of that unrelatable, poorly written character. 

That entire equation is fueled by the initial desire to write an inclusive character above the desire to write an authentic story. You can't see yourself in these characters regardless of background because they are just props in someone's persecution fantasy.

You can write perfectly meaningful, relatable stories that are also inclusive without making sure that's the driving factor. Into the Spider-Verse is a perfect example. It tells Mile's story in his world as he perceives it, it shows his character flaws, his strengths, good and bad choices he made and the repercussions for those choices. It shows his limitations that he wasn't even aware of. It shows the world through the culture he lives every day.

Yes, that is part of good storytelling and a better storyteller might be able to make Captain Marvel work better as a character, yet the desire to put this woman empowerment ideal on a pedestal above everything else and to write her through that lens though caused her to be a shit character. It occluded the options available to the character's story because they didn't want to write her in a bad light at all due to being afraid of tarnishing that ideal and that's entirely a product of the initial desire to write this character for its identity message. That's why other strong female leads aren't criticized in that way, like Ripley, because they weren't written backwards to serve an agenda.",1,kid785w

Calling him a fly boy? How is that woke, but calling Han a Scruffy Nerf Herder is not? That's the same thing. As far as refusing to tell him the plan, apparently, you didn't watch the entire movie or were upset by a female character outranking a male character.

I mean, damn, her back story is being poor and a servant to the rich people at the casino, but it doesn't make sense that she would think the stampeding animals weren't worth it?

Stopping the attack on the ""New Death Star,"" I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to as there wasn't anything quite like a ""New Death Star"" in the Last Jedi. Are you referring to Snoke's ship? That's more like Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer. Or are you talking about the battering ram machine that was going to be used to get into the base? Yeah, it wasn't ""win through love."" it was literally about not sacrificing oneself needlessly. EVEN if it was true, Luke did something similar for his dad. 

> I hated this movie, but if I said so online, people assume it's because of bigotry.

I can understand why after seeing your reasoning. Either you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire franchise, or you didn't actually fully watch the movie. Judging by your descriptions, the common denominators are that female characters were in positions of authority over the male characters or made a decision that went against them. So, yeah, you pretty sufficiently described your views as being in misogyny.  If you don't like the movie, cool, no movie is for everyone. But your complaints seem focused on the fact they're women, even when there was either an explanation or has been done by a male without complaint from you in a different Star Wars movie.

That means that if people are having a bunch of sex because they think they should but don't want to, no, they're not empowered because they're caving to outside pressure. However, if people want to explore multiple partners and especially if they do so despite being raised in an environment where the only accepted choice is to have one partner or something similar, then yes that can be empowering for those people to make the choices that are right for them in the face of pressure to do otherwise from their social circles. 

The general sexual liberation movement has been empowering for a lot of people, because the way society was before that wouldn't fit what some people want, so having other people step up before them and break rigid cultural norms helps people who want to pursue multiple sexual partners do so, as they don't feel as alone or deviant or whatever in doing so.

I grew up in a strict religion and was told women shouldn’t seek out orgasms. When I started having natural human urges, I sincerely thought something was wrong with me. I wasted a lot of time hating myself, which is inherently disempowering because I spent so much of my life trying to make myself small so people wouldn’t notice how “broken” I was for craving it. 

When I started having sex with good partners who cared about my experience, it was the first time I saw myself as attractive, likable, and normal. I had some very kind partners who made sure I had spaces to share fantasies and experiment. That was a significant healing period for me because this part of myself that I hated for so long became something others accepted and even enjoyed. 

Experimenting with different partners and acts unlocked a life pleasure I didn’t think I’d ever have. It was like eating mush all of my life and then discovering food with flavor. It’s not like sex gave me a reason to live, but it did make life more colorful. I hold a deep respect for all of my past partners, everything they taught me, and all we experienced together. 

Some people achieve that level of sexual satisfaction with one partner, but for me having multiple was indeed empowering because I got to try different things and learn what felt good. I loved the chase, the satisfaction of “closing the deal,” and the period of discovering how to pleasure another person. 

While I don’t think having a colorful past makes me a better person or even inherently more interesting, it did give me a pretty significant confidence boost. People often ask me how I have so few insecurities, and I laugh to myself. 

Indulging in something for pure enjoyment can be really fulfilling for someone who believed at one point that that kind of enjoyment was evil. In that sense, it’s a form of empowerment for someone like me.",2,18ftr93

Let's think about it here for a second: 

What do most people strive for besides money and material possessions? Confidence. And seeing as how in the new age, people categorize confidence with attraction. What is the best way to make yourself feel attractive? Sex. The more bodies you can pull, the more you realize how attractive you are. Who's the next hot guy or girl I can pull? I feel like it's almost a point to prove. Don't get me wrong, I was there at one point. I went from someone who had sex with one person for eight years, lost my virginity to the same guy I dated for those eight years, and when I finally became single, without sharing numbers, I was completely unhinged. I felt so confident and attractive and I realized I could get anyone I wanted, any way I wanted. It makes my skin crawl now that I'm older.

I don’t exactly see how that empowers. If anything I would think denying men sex would be empowering, I suppose they aren’t mutually exclusive. I don’t have a problem with slutty girls btw, but I would never date one. At my age I wouldn’t date anyone over like a 5-6 body count. 

For men it’s different, any woman could go out and get laid if they wanted to, even if you’re ugly there’s plenty of desperate guys. Take a fairly pretty woman and ask a hundred guys if they would sleep with her, 100% are saying yes, put a decent looking man on the street and ask 100 women if they’d sleep with him, I bet maybe at best like 30 would say they might. That’s just the nature of sexual selection in mammals, obviously there’s exceptions to the rule. But for most guys it can be exceptionally hard to get laid outside of having a girlfriend. You have to either be good looking, funny, or just that energy about you. Either just supremely confident and good at flirting, or the douchey womanizer energy which many/most women are attracted to otherwise those guys wouldn’t get pussy. Not to go all ‘niceguy’ here I’m not saying there’s a problem with it, or that any man is entitled to sex just because of who they are or whatever. I’m mostly saying that that’s why most guys don’t want easy girlfriends, and why being a slut isn’t really viewed positively.

This is why having non-community/non-family/non-church based resources (like web pages, books, libraries, advocacy groups, etc.) is so important. Just because church says that you're supposed to shut up and submit doesn't mean that it works for everyone. Just because your family tells you that your needs don't matter doesn't mean that you'll believe them. Keeping people in ignorance is harmful. 

For example, if you have multiple partners, then when your new spouse tries to put THAT in THERE, you'll already know that you don't enjoy it, and you'll nope out. Having a bunch of negative experiences with people other than the one you're not bound to ""for the rest of your life"", and avoids the resentments that comes from those experiences. Having multiple partners means that you'll be able to communicate better, because you've learned from experience, what works for you - because not all men approach sex the same way. 

> there's basically zero chance of a sexually gratifying relationship.

Again - some men will take the message of ""she's supposed to shut up and do what I want"" to heart, and treat their wives like chattel. But some are going to be kinder, and be more invested in bringing her pleasure, even if they don't know how. Again, not all men are the same, even in the same church/community.

I hate how sexism is always presumed whenever there is a discrepancy between men and women in any profession, when there are a thousand possible factors. Even social and systemic factors can contribute to the disparity, yet those factors may not be sexist.

Basically, my point is that we should allow disparities to exist in society unless there is good evidence that sexism or patriarchy are at play.

1. Name 1 Republican President since Reagan that did what he said he would do. Trump is the first. He halted illegal immigration. He fought hard and eventually won the wall. He cut worthless regulations by the hundreds to thousands. He sent the economy into record territory. He put 3 Constitutionalists on the Supreme Court. He put over 200 conservative judges on Federal benches. He was tough on our supposed allies who have cheated us for decades. He made us energy independent. No new wars. He rebuilt our military. He furthered peace in the Middle East. Tax cuts for the Middle class. And that is just off the top of my head.

2. His policy was extremely effective. Americans are far better off today with what Trump did as President  vs. what Hillary would have done. Unless of course you hate America and what it has always stood for.

3. The world hated him because he was effective. The free rides were ending under Trump. NAFTA cancelled. The Asian Pacific trade agreement under Obama was scrapped completely. It was a disaster for America. He was working on European trade when his 4 years ended. We pay for European socialism. That was going to end, and they knew it. So they hated him. Germany stopped laughing when, as Trump warned them, Russia used natural gas as a weapon, cutting it off. Trump was spot on. His foreign policy was nearly flawless from an American viewpoint. 

4. He knows the rats nest of leftists in the bureaucracy and can counter their treason on day one. Other candidates will try to get along, and will be perpetually undermined by the radicals in high government positions. He already made this mistake,  and it cost him precious time. No one on the Republican side has this experience and can counter it effectively on day one.

For the record, I don't care much for the man. He is too much pageantry and blowhard. The New Yorker shines too brightly. But he is hardly what the leftists in the media portray.

All three are just MAGA without Trump. Don't think for a moment any of them would even marginally return the GOP to a party interested in governing over engaging in culture wars.

I do think, however, that the GOP, and MAGA in particular aren't driven nearly as much by hate as by fear. Listen to how every GOP candidate speaks -- each one (except Christie, but look where that got him) has a very dark view of this country. They see failure, doom, and gloom at every turn. Every speech is about how the country is failing here, or in terrible trouble there, or losing its way someplace else. None of them speak about anything that they think the USA is good at or does well, or provides for a hopeful future.

That anyone votes for any of them demonstrates that the GOP voters see this country in the most negative light possible and they want to be led by someone who tells them that their fears are valid and real. They want to know that there is a boogeyman and that whoever they elect will keep the monster under the bed from destroying them.

Their fears are viewed as hateful because they are predominately afraid of people who aren't just like them, and who they don't feel they can control  -- because such people aren't keeping the party firmly grounded in the 1960s era USA that they think they remember. They are afraid of immigrants because they grew up with only white people (and the occasional ""good <one of them>"") in their neighborhoods. They are afraid of the modern economy because they don't know how to survive in a technocratic world. They are afraid of government and governing because they can't conceive of a government that cares about the little guy.

Look at every policy the GOP promulgates (to the very limited extent that the GOP is interested in policy at all) and you'll see a policy rooted in fear. Look at every speech they give, and you'll see either a candidate who is equally afraid of the modern world or one who is pandering to those fears to gain or retain power. But in practice, there's no difference between the two options.

I believe the culture of the MAGA movement is one that is based on hate, if only because the policies espoused by the leaders in the movement (Trump, Bannon, Tucker, Hannity, etc.) are usually based on in-group/out-group ethics where the out groups tend to be minorities, the poor, LGBTQ+ people, anyone not Evangelical (with a carveout for Israel), and so forth.

First, there are the leaders who are in it to enrich themselves and grift the people below them. This would include Trump, Hannity, Tucker, and so forth. They may have mildly hate-filled views, but they aren't actually there *because* of the hate, they're there because the hate sells.

This would go for Bannon, Stephen Miller, Fuentes, and so forth, plus a subset of constituents who are hateful people and like that they are being given a permission structure in which to freely hate. These are people who genuinely believe that non-white, non-straight people are inferior and should have all the power of the state brought to bear to oppress them.

Third and finally, there are the remainder which I believe is a majority of Republican voters today. These people are not specifically hate-filled. These are the bystanders that watch a mob lynch an innocent man and don't specifically cheer or grab the rope but also don't do anything to stop them. I don't think any of them would take active steps to harm a minority, a member of the LGBTQ+, someone with a disability, a Muslim or an atheist, etc. I would say these are the people that would quickly say ""No, I'm not racist, I have a black friend."" 

I don't think these people have the same hate as the first (playacted) or second (genuine) groups. It is absolutely the case that their political action -- that is, voting for the Republican party -- empowers hateful actions to take place through policy and sometimes actual state action (kids in cages, etc.). But none of them, given the opportunity, would grab the arm of a brown child and rip them away from their parent at the border. In fact, they might feel a bit of shame if they were in proximity to it being done.

It is the distance, in fact, that keeps the shame away. They don't happen to know a gay couple and they might turn their nose up at it, but it's not like *they* would go protest a gay wedding. They've seen the textbooks and *they* would never be the ones screaming at Ruby Bridges as she tries to walk into the school in Little Rock.

I don't know that I could effectively articulate what it is that they are filled with that isn't hate. Perhaps it's more a lack of empathy, or an abundance of apathy, or an ample dose of denial. If there is any hate there, it's more a byproduct of the above.

I think it's easy to see the rallies and the marches and the MAGA hats and see a nation half-full of abhorrent people. But I'd be willing to bet the average Trump voter filling up their gas tank in Tuscaloosa, Alabama isn't daily or even monthly engaging in activities of harm toward their fellow man. Just once or twice a year, they pull a lever to give rise to the people that do, for a myriad of reasons that aren't the subject of your CMV.",1,199unuw

But that isn't the full picture, and even for the hatred it is important to look at the root causes.

Often the people supporting him are from areas that are largely left off campaign trails, including by Republicans. (Which he is able to do because he refused to pay his security and other fees on many of these places).  So he does show that he represents people who are systematically forgotten.

That is a large part of why so many people still support the electoral college which allows him to win. They rightly feel like because they are a much smaller percentage of the population that their voices will go unheard without. (I am against the electoral college but the fear is still real).  He gives a voice to these people.

Financial support and major industries have largely pulled out of many of these places leaving many of them unable to work, or at least unable to work for wages that will sustain them. They're being told by other politicians that we are going to eliminate the only jobs they still have, like oil and coal. Even those that don't rely on it because they are already gone, want to stand up for those who still have those jobs because they were directly impacted by the loss.

Most of them genuinely aren't aware of just how much he contradicts himself, or the ramifications of his policies. When it is reported on during their news, they don't hear the follow up on the effects months later when it becomes apparent how it actually hurt the people voting for him.

A lot of them want to be heard, respected, and advocated for. He tells them they are heard, respected and advocated for. Then the major news stations that report positively on him tell those people that he is the best chance they have, that everyone else around them loves him, and that anyone that doesn't is the enemy.

If you want to try and save your argument by applying your own arbitrary standard whereby “MAGA crowd” only refers to the *most* adamant supporters (as defined by whatever narrows it down enough to stop your argument from being invalidated), all he needs to do is point out that he himself is MAGA and gay and your argument is still invalidated. And, to be sure, no matter how much you try to arbitrarily narrow it down, there will be someone included who still has the exact same views he expressed (bc “spoiler alert:” his view is pretty typical among Trump supporters).",0,kigw7oi

I am a conservative, and I don't hate Trump, I just don't like him for the GOP candidate. I didn't in 2016, I didn't in 2020, and I don't for 2024. Aside from his flaws as a man, I am really disappointed in his policy positions. 

I frequent right leaning to far right media sources and pay attention to the popular and niche commenters so I can understand why people support him. None of it has changed my position.

President Trump's defense argued in favour of lawlessness. Without witnesses Republicans have accepted that the President is above any checks and balances, that the president is above the law. President Trump's defense argued that if the President perceives their actions to be in the best interest of Americans than the President is above the law and can solicit foreign election interference. They are normalizing lawlessness. The evidence is so overwhelming that their best defense is that the President is above the law.

For those interested Adam Schiff made incredibly compelling arguments throughout the trial and posted clips on twitter. I'll link a few below;

> - *Over the past week, we've seen a descent into Constitutional madness. The President and his team argue that any conduct is okay, as long as a president thinks it will benefit him. That's an argument of pure desperation — one you only make when you know your client is guilty.*^[[1]](https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1222986279509536777)

___________

> - *The pattern of his words and conduct is clear: President Trump thinks he is above the law. He thinks he is the state. Trump said it himself: Under Article II I can do whatever I want. Precisely what our Founders feared. Precisely why they drafted the remedy of impeachment.*^[[2]](https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1222624768819638284)

____________

> - *The idea that abuse of power isn’t impeachable would’ve terrified our Founders. You can’t write off a consensus of Constitutional scholars by calling them “Never Trumpers,” Unless we're prepared to accept that Article II really does allow the President to do whatever he wants.*^[[3]](https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1222676757343588352)

__________

> - *We’ve seen a remarkable lowering of the bar. According to Trump’s lawyers, everything is okay as long as the president believes it helps his reelection. It’s not okay to solicit foreign election interference, even if you fail. It just makes you a failed crook.*^[[4]](https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1222886284139606016)

________

> - *Trump’s defense has retreated to their last defense: He’s guilty as sin, but the voters should clean up this mess. We must ask ourselves: Can we trust the President will not continue to try to cheat in that very election?

1. In a phone call with the President of Ukraine, President Trump repeatedly urged newly elected President Zelensky to investigate former VP Joe Biden. President Trump offered the assistance of the American Justice Department, Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.^[[1]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukrainian-president-shows-him-offering-us-assistance-for-biden-investigation/2019/09/25/16aa36ca-df0f-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html?outputType=amp&utm_source=reddit.com)

2. Attorney General Barr attempted to cover all of this up by denying the whistle blower from going to Congress.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/us/politics/william-barr-trump-ukraine.html)

3. Following President Zelenksy asking for foreign military aid President Trump segued into asking the Ukrainian President to investigate his political opponent.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/official-readout-president-trump-s-july-25-phone-call-with-ukraine-s-volodymyr-zelensky/4b228f51-17e7-45bc-b16c-3b2643f3fbe0/)

>President Zelensky: Yes you are·absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% arid I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing·on the issues with the
sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than.the European Union and- I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot forUkraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

>President Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There- are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation .. I think you are surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yestrday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance-, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.

>...The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor bf New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United states, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad
news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.

**So what does this conversation mean? When President Zelensky asked about military aid President Trump immediately segued the conversation into opening an investigation into the supposed Ukrainian involvement with the 2016 election interference (a thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory spread by the Russian Military Services online) and an investigation into Biden.**

President Trump is referring to a thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory that the FBI and CrowdStrike failed to seize a DNC folder that supposedly held information about the hack that supposedly the *""deep state""* was hiding the truth about Hillary Clinton's emails. This conspiracy theory was pushed by President Trump in July of 2018 during his visit with Putin when Trump refused to say that Russia was engaged with cyber warfare and were involved with the DNC hack. CrowdStrike didn't withhold information and the FBI recovered all missing material from the Clinton scandal concluding that the investigation *""found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.""*^[[4]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-promotes-conspiracy-theory-clinton-s-deleted-emails-are-ukraine-n1058726)

Furthermore, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Trump claims was supposedly *""very good""* was unfairly shut down by Vice-President Biden because he supposedly feared his son was being investigated. This is a complete mischaracterization of events. Following Ukraine's revolution and the annexation of Crimea Ukrainian President Poroshenko was dealing with corruption by the elite. Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was a discredited individual who was leading an investigation into corruption. For example following assistance from the International Monetary Fund a $1.8 billion loan to help the Ukrainian banking system disappeared offshore in accounts owned by a Ukrainian Oligach.^[[5]](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/12/30/corruption-in-ukraine-is-so-bad-a-nigerian-prince-would-be-embarrassed-2/) Shokin also fired prosecutors who were working on corruption cases against corrupt officials.^[[6]](https://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/anticorruption-meeting-410708) Following pressure from Western Allies the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly voted to fire Prosecutor General Shokin. The decision was celebrated by Western Allies providing financial support to Ukraine including the European Union.^[[7]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/world/europe/political-stability-in-the-balance-as-ukraine-ousts-top-prosecutor.html) Moreover, former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko refuted President Trump's conspiracy that Biden forced the firing for Shokin to protect his son, Hunter Biden, who had been working in Ukraine. Prosecutor General Lutsenko stated that *""“[f]rom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,”* and added *“Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival.”^[[8]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/former-ukraine-prosecutor-says-hunter-biden-did-not-violate-anything/2019/09/26/48801f66-e068-11e9-be7f-4cc85017c36f_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com)*

Like I said, this is politics as usual.  His job is to get her elected.  He will do whatever he can.  For her sake, it's actually more beneficial the less she knows, but again, that's not her ethical violation.  Even if there was criminal activity (there isn't) and he lost his job (he won't) it still doesn't link to her directly, which is what matters.

>Sorry you're okay with bribery and FEC violations, but I'm not.

Never said that, actually, if you read my comment, I said it's definitely shady, but nothing explicitly illegal or ruining for Hillary Clinton, and nothing that makes her seem like a worse alternative to Trump.  It's funny, reading all of your ""scathing"" allegations, surely a morally upstanding guy like you would also reject The Don, possibly the only person I could have imagined would run with an even shadier financial and legal history.  A man currently involved in terrible lawsuits.  Surely you're outraged.  Surely.  But no, no you aren't, it's much worse that her team is trying to get her elected.  How immoral.  Surely Trump's campaign is innocent of all of this as well.  They're just morally superior! Only, no, not even Glenn Beck of all people agrees.  Even he called Hillary the morally superior candidate.  That's how low Trump sits.  

>Nice deflection at the end, I'm not even going to waste my time addressing it.

Roger that, sometimes when I lose an argument I quit too.  Especially when I realize I'm too big of a pussy to admit I don't care that my candidate is inciting anti-Semitism and racial hatred (or hey, maybe you even like it).

The French occupation of Algeria did not end when the Arabs ""stopped teaching their children to hate the French"". It's wishful thinking of an occupier to place the entire blame for the occupation on the occupied people.

Israel's ""generous offers"" are a myth – The Palestinians have never been offered anything constituting a viable state. The offer made at [Camp David](http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-myth-of-the-generous-offer/):

>The annexations and security arrangements would divide the West Bank into three disconnected cantons. In exchange for taking fertile West Bank lands that happen to contain most of the region’s scarce water aquifers, Israel offered to give up a piece of its own territory in the Negev Desert–about one-tenth the size of the land it would annex–including a former toxic waste dump.

> [Israel] would annex strategically important and highly valuable sections of the West Bank–while retaining “security control” over other parts–that would have made it impossible for the Palestinians to travel or trade freely within their own state without the permission of the Israeli government

>Because of the geographic placement of Israel’s proposed West Bank annexations, Palestinians living in their new “independent state” would be forced to cross Israeli territory every time they traveled or shipped goods from one section of the West Bank to another, and Israel could close those routes at will. Israel would also retain a network of so-called “bypass roads” that would crisscross the Palestinian state while remaining sovereign Israeli territory, further dividing the West Bank.

>Israel was also to have kept “security control” for an indefinite period of time over the Jordan Valley, the strip of territory that forms the border between the West Bank and neighboring Jordan. Palestine would not have free access to its own international borders with Jordan and Egypt–putting Palestinian trade, and therefore its economy, at the mercy of the Israeli military.

If we're referring to Taba, then the Israelis were the one's who pulled out of the talks:

>At Taba, Israel dropped its demand to control Palestine’s borders and the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians, for the first time, made detailed counterproposals–in other words, counteroffers–showing which changes to the 1967 borders they would be willing to accept. The Israeli map that has emerged from the talks shows a fully contiguous West Bank, though with a very narrow middle and a strange gerrymandered western border to accommodate annexed settlements.
In the end, however, all this proved too much for Israel’s Labor prime minister. On January 28, Barak unilaterally broke off the negotiations. “The pressure of Israeli public opinion against the talks could not be resisted,” Ben-Ami said (New York Times, 7/26/01).

> the Palestinians voted in Hamas, a terrorist organization and it used the land to continue to terrorize Israel.

Believe me, I despise Hamas. But when you brutally occupy a people for 50 years, they start to hate you. That's what violence does. Christ, the Israeli public elected Ariel Sharon, someone personally responsible for [the mass murder of thousands of civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre). 

The rocket fire from the Gaza strip is reprehensible. But desperate, occupied people tend not to fight fair. If you didn't want them to use any means at their disposal, maybe you shouldn't have spent 50 years brutalising them.

I think you know very well that Israel never once offered the Palestinians a viable state. They wanted to keep the settlements, which will partition the already tiny West Bank, and offered worthless desert land in return. Secondly, they want access to the water supply of the West Bank. Thirdly, Israel refused to give back East Jerusalem, which was seized during the 1967 war and is therefore not considered part of Israel according to international law. That equates to a significant portion of the West Bank being lost with nothing of value given in return. No dignified person can accept that.

>Gaza has fixed borders, a beach front, and it had money to build a thriving economy. But instead of creating an oasis, the Palestinians voted in Hamas, a terrorist organization and it used the land to continue to terrorize Israel.

You conveniently left out the fact that Israel introduced sanctions immediately following HAMAS' election victory as a punishment, which was followed by a crippling blockade in response to HAMAS defeating FATAH during street battled when the latter attempted to overthrow it. Also, Israel prevents Gaza from developing the area. They cannot import or export anything. They wanted to build a sea and air port, and Israel refused. They cannot even use all of their farmland because it is too close to the border. On top of that, Israel bombs the hell out of the region every few years. Just what kind of oasis are you imagining? Also, you do realize that Israel shoots itself in the foot in the long-term with this kind of behavior, right? Treating human beings like that is begging for extremists elements to flourish.

>What makes you think it would be different in the West Bank? What makes you think the green line would make any difference when the Palestinians teach their children that the entire land is Palestinian and to hate the Jews?

When Israel expels your people, humiliates them, blockades them, denies their national identity, treats them like animals, allows settlers to terrorize them, and bombs them, they don't need Mickey Mouse to tell them to hate Israel. 

**Like all people, the Palestinians just want to pursue their life goals and live free of oppression. Stop the occupation, treat them like human beings *for once*, and eventually the hatred for Israel will subside. But most importantly, stop trying to dehumanize them into some kind of alien savage race in order to justify Israeli crimes against them.

edit for more snark:

It also explains why Rabin was murdered by Palestinian extremists and not right-wing Israelis. It explains why [the Palestinians attack so much](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/gaza-ceasefire-violations) and force Israeli forces to shell kids on beaches, or to flatten whole blocks and a hospital. Palestinians use human shields, you see, the Hannibal directive has nothing to do with it ever, and don't ask for sources either, while ignoring the instances of the IDF forcing families to stay in houses they occupy. They spray skunk water to calm people down, and they ""map"" the population by having everybody get up in the middle of the night to be photographed to give people a sense of what it's like to have dignity. [Undercover agents throwing stones](http://972mag.com/watch-israeli-undercover-agents-shoot-unarmed-boy-at-point-blank-range/112474/) are really the only way to blend in with these hateful Palestinians.

And of coures, people like [Stav Shaffir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3Pwjyt8bM) or [Max Blumenthal](http://www.alternet.org/world/painting-palestinians-nazis-netanyahu-incites-wave-vigilante-violence) are just full of it, anyway. They just hate those Israelis who want nothing but annex land peacefully. Noam Chomsky and Normal Finkelstein obviousy loathe themselves, and so on.

Seriously though, the people who dream of ""Greater Israel"" and the people who want to ""free ALL Palestine"" as they euphemistically put it, are two sides of the same coin, and they feed off each other. Peace has nothing to do with it. And I agree, neither does stabbing people have to do with ""resistance"", when I say two sides of the same coin I mean that. But when two people fuck up, and you all group around one of them and declare the other a saint, then even regardless of who occupies who and military power, it's just common decency to concentrate on what is being glossed over, not so much on what everybody and their dog is parroting already. It's not like I'm not familiar with PalWatch and what they point out, or distorted or faked stuff AKA ""Pallywood"", and how people just pass that on without thinking. That's all gross and stupid and reckless, and no doubt often racist. It certainly proudly displays tribal thinking, one group good, other bad, to be exaggerated infinitely.

But neither of the crimes and BS in certain camps on each ""side"" excuse the other else. If you think one side is pure you're on crack. The people on each side who are for human rights and international law are the closest to that, but they don't exactly get much attention now do they.

You neglect to mention why there were fantatical Jews in the first place. Need I remind you about the ethnic cleansing in Europe at the time?

At this late stage I would agree. The Holocaust is long over and the Arabs that believe in the destruction of Jews are week and make pathetic attempts to attack, vise versa you have the appalling behaviour by some settlers as well whom seem to have very similar motives.

Yeah, they're more concerned with what the US supports, but I respect that. It's the same reason I care about this in the least, the German government does suck up and the Holocaust is both part of the cause of the situation and it gets used by Israeli right-wingers.

I love the quotes they use around the term ""Registered Residents."" If you dont live there, dont fucking go there and start some shit. 

> Some residents refused to submit their names to a security list required for them to enter their own homes freely. Others are denied entry for various intolerable reasons.

Notice how they dont say why the residents wont submit their names. Story of the middle east, ""Buwah... We live there!"" What, is it suddenly against Islam to tell the government your name? 

> Tel Rumeida resembles a ghost town. Visible residents are settlers, many openly displaying guns, protected by heavily armed soldiers in combat gear.

Wait, this is the  same town they were talking about above, with the requirement to actually be a registered resident! And yet they are openly moving about, armed for protection... which flies in the face of earlier statements! 

> Palestinian shops and other businesses were closed, their owners denied access. Draconian measures were imposed on area villages and towns, sealed off like Hebron.

So wait, these are the same people who wont submit their names to get a security pass... this is just another consequence of their recalcitrant behavior.

So just another business as usual checkpoint. Travel is far from impossible. And given the preponderance of youth based violence going on in the entire region, suspecting youth of being terrorists is a fucking sensible precaution. 

> Thousands of Palestinians endure severe disruptions to their daily lives, collectively punished, commonplace Israeli policy – US major media ignoring what’s ongoing entirely, reporting nothing, horrific human rights abuses unnoticed.

And you think the Israeli's arent suffering disruptions too? They have the fucking mongolian horde at their gates stabbing and shooting people daily! 

And why the fuck should Major Media here give a damn? It's a fucking shithole that's only getting worse because of radicalized assholes who go off at the drop of a hat when some Imam somewhere gets a rage boner. 

> Hebron-based Youth Against Settlements (YAS) is an activist group against Israeli colonization of Palestine – “through non-violent popular struggle and civil disobedience,” explaining:

So a group dedicated to opposing any settlements wants to spout their shit. Lets see how this plays out cotton. 

> Ostensibly to protect approximately 600 fundamentalist Israelis that have forcibly established a settlement right in the heart of Hebron, the Israeli state has imposed on the Palestinian residents of the city a regime of forced evictions, curfews, market closures, street closures, military checkpoints, subjection to military law including frequent random searches and detention without charge, and lack of protection from rampant settler violence, which has pressured approximately 13,000 Palestinian civilians to flee their homes in the Hebron city center, turning it into a virtual ghost town.

So in the middle of a bustling city, there just so happens to be a commune of jews living there? Far from a colony. 

And more complaints about how horrible and awful it is the lawful controling power imposes any safety restrictions to prevent civil unrest. Which is terrible for the YAS group who make their living CAUSING unrest. 

And if it's so fucking bad there, and thousands have been fleeing... how many were there to start with? How many are left? 

> The area is surrounded by hostile settlements, Palestinian residents terrorized by harassment, violence, and vandalism, Israeli closed military zones imposed to displace them from their own land – forcing them to leave, preventing their return, confiscating their property and possessions, whatever they can’t take with them.

Again, apparently the entirety of Palestine is surrounded and hemmed in from all sides by billions of evil jews. 

And a lot of the violence that they are terrorized by, is their own fucking people wrecking things. 

And since they are unable to control themselves, it's natural for Israel to bring forces in to maintain law and order. 

> Settlers urge them to kill the Palestinians. “They are rejoicing that they took over my home and building,” Amro explained. “One of the soldiers said that they were (raiding the home) as punishment for speaking to the international media about what’s happening in Hebron.”

Unfounded accusations.

Ukraine hasn't just been 'holding out,' Ukraine has done more damage militarily to Russia **THAN AFGHANISTAN DID**. In literally 1/10th the time.

And Russia isn't going to use Nukes, period, the leader that gives that order would be shot before it ever made it to the people with the power to actually push the buttons. So that really eliminates the one advantage Russia has over Ukraine.

Plus, given Putin has Leukemia, we really only have to wait maybe a year, maybe two depending on how badly sanctions are cutting off medical supplies, before he's dead.

Kissinger isn't pragmatic, he's a fascist piece of dogshit that should be dragged through the streets naked tied to a high-torque truck on a particularly high grip asphalt.

He is one of the worst living human beings left on the planet. I hate Putin, but Putin wishes he was half the monster Henry Kissinger is.

worldnews,uxa2g1,Henry Kissinger: Ukraine should give up territory to Russia to reach peace,48,ChocolateTsar,i9yn0s4,t1_i9yhqbw,ItchyThunder,"But that is not likely. Russia has 1 authoritarian leader and government. Unlike the former Yugoslavia, it has one predominant ethnic and religious group (ethnic Russians). There one predominant language that everyone in Russia and most people in Ukraine speak (Russian). The ethnic & religious conflict that existed in the former Yugoslavia and the various Balkan countries either doesn't exist in Russia, or is highly localized and controlled (Chechnia under Kadyrov, who is Putin's right hand man and basically runs the show in that republic). The point is that there is certain reality that exists on the ground that may be different from what we, you, me, Reddit or anyone else wants. 

It's like saying - I would love for Chechnia to be independent as many Chechens wanted in the 90s. Well, that issue was put to rest after the Russian armed forced carpet bombed Grozny and many other towns during the Chechen war. Obviously, this was a war crime and terrible, but we don't have control over Putin and his oligarchs. It is what it is. Kissinger understands the realities on the ground, he has a lot of experience in that area. We can disagree with him, but it makes sense to listen to his arguments and debate on issues and facts, not on the reflective hate (he is bad, so anything he has is bad/corrupt/wrong).",3,i9yhqbw

Entertaining this thought for a moment, what would a ceasefire actually look like? Assuming Ukraine gives up territory and Russia annexes it, then what? Ukraine will want assurances that no further military action will be taken, which effectively they can only get by Russia signing some level of Minsk Accords. Those in turn would likely hold a clause that any future conflict will result in direct involvement by NATO, no matter the membership application status. I am not arguing on how plausible such a clause is, but I am saying that whatever cease fire agreement happens, Ukraine will try to put as much teeth into it in order to deter another invasion.

Personally, I agree with the user above. No matter a ceasefire, Russia will plan for another invasion and continue to annex more, simply because ""why not"". So what would a cease fire agreement effectively look like?",2,i9wlzoc

That could potentially be the source of the misunderstanding at the heart of the article. Early on in the uptick of Covid-19 cases in the US, it was determined that for the less-serious stages of the condition, BiPAP machines can be retrofitted by hospital employees to include a filter to prevent aerosol spread of disease (which would otherwise occur as a consequence of treating Covid-19 patients with those machines). They're helpful, and leave more ventilators available for the more serious stages of the condition. As far as I'm aware, those aren't generally called ""ventilators"" -- ""ventilators"" tend to be bigger, more-expensive things. However, when Elon Tweeted that he bought 1000 of them, **he referred to them as ""ventilators""**.

Separately, Tesla (and I think SpaceX as well) is also ramping up production of actual ventilators in coordination with Medtronic... and also purchased some Medtronic ventilators and distributed those. Perhaps somebody (possibly even on both sides of the communication) mixed up the **Elon-purchased BiPAP's** (which Elon referred to as ""ventilators"") with the **Tesla-produced ventilators** (which are not yet available) and/or the **few Medtronic ventilators that Tesla has already distributed**. To add to the confusion, Elon's been shipping these out across the country - not just to California (in part because NY and NJ needed them more).. and rather than dealing with governments, he's preferred to take requests directly from hospitals that have ""immediate need"" and directly send them out on their word. I only happen to know this shit because I'm an Elon fanboy and read all his Tweets (a bunch of which were hospitals receiving the stuff) and Twitter replies. It's easy to understand how someone might have gotten this confused somewhere (which I would argue is unacceptable for a journalist, but forgivable for whatever California government employee might have taken a question without preparation).",1,fnlmzj9

In this article, the reporter refers to the ""1,000 ventilators"" that Elon received.. and possibly asked people if ""ventilators"" got delivered (actual ventilators haven't) instead of properly calling them BiPAP's. So any consistency in this discussion is busted from the start, due to the confused context provided by the article.

It's true for a few days, most everyone thought those were ventilators.. and that was followed up by a few days of confusion where people reflexively defended Elon's description without a basis for it. Elon-related (and Tesla-related too) news is a shit-show, so there's a prolonged process and period of doubt involved in sorting anything out. I'd ask for some sympathy - lots of Elon fans do care about science/truth/education/whatever quite a lot (since much interest stems from geeky space and electric accomplishments), but things are a mess.

Edit: FWIW, I just actually Googled to see how a BiPap is described. I think Johns Hopkins is a credible enough source, which also propagates standard terminology: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/bipap (spoiler: According to the description in the first paragraph, it's ""a type of ventilator"".

I was close to Kanye and from where I was standing you couldn't tell he was in a wheelchair, as everyone was standing up in front of him blocking him. Then all the people around him were like, ""he's in a wheelchair!"" and Kanye was like, ""oh he's in a wheelchair?"" and just was like cool then and continued on.

news,2gd9kr,Kanye West halts Sydney concert after two fans refuse to stand up - doesn't realise one is in a wheelchair and the other is disabled,7430,Another-Chance,cki3bsb,t3_2gd9kr,Kindorfel,"I say this to a lot to people. Kanye isn't in-and-out of rehab or jail. He doesn't carry a gun or associate with gang members. His songs don't promote crime or violence. He's not flashing his balls as he climbs in and out of his sports car for free press... he's not even a man whore. He's had like 2 girlfriends in 12 years, one of which became his wife and the other, he loved so much, that when she left him he wrote an entire album dealing with his broken heart. The lyric ""I want to fuck you hard over the sink"" might not be the most romantic sounding thing anyone has ever heard, but it's pretty sweet when you consider, in context, he's singing about how he wants to make love to his wife, whom he's very open about loving, as opposed to all of the other rappers who talk about they want to fuck everyone elses wive because all women are whores who don't deserve respect. Writing a song about how much you love your wife isn't something that should get you persecuted in the media. He writes about working hard and following your dreams. He sings about love for his family, falling in love, and starting a family of his own. He doesn't sport colors or sag his pants so his underwear shows... he wears high fashion, and tries to look good. He's confident in his ability as a musician and artist and he's open to the world about his innermost thoughts. You can't ever say Kanye isn't 'real'. ...and yet, the world hates him. Rothesburger raped a woman in the bathroom and people everywhere root for him to win the Superbowl. Kanye says ""be yourself, follow your dreams"", and people want him and his family burned alive. Pretty sad.

I went to a show were the perfomer told all the men in the audience to turn around cause it was a new song he wrote for just for the ladies, and he didnt want his core male audience to make fun off him... it was funny and a good time...

> Because he was getting the audience pumped up. At seated venues, people will often feel awkward about standing, even though they want to. Having the performer encourage everyone to get up makes it socially acceptable, and then everyone has a better time. Except for the handicapped people possibly...


>But yeah, I was at one of his Melbourne shows a few nights earlier, and he managed to get everyone on their feet. He called out some people for not standing by saying 'look, even that dude on crutches is standing' (dude promptly waved his crutches to applause) and then once the crowd (playfully) booed them, they stood up and then were applauded.

news,1xyegt,Actress Ellen Page has come out as a lesbian,1091,makedomend,cfgflj9,t1_cffy6nf,freakorgeek,"A mod.

I wouldn't worry about it, mods of very large subs are under *constant* stress to keep good content coming, and keep out ""bad"" content. How ""bad"" is defined tends to fluctuate based on who complains the loudest at any given time, which mod is there to listen to it, or whatever. Sometimes mods change subreddit rules based on one comment that happened to be well written enough to get a bunch of people to say, ""yeah that sounds right"" and upvote it, when in reality the issue was much more complicated, it's just that the other side couldn't be heard because of the random chaotic forces that govern viral internet content.

It says TMZ because it's a tag that was created to go on posts containing celebrity gossip, many of which come from TMZ. The slash here means either or, so TMZ is wrong in this case but that's okay, it's just a general tag.
