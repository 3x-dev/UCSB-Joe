edit for more snark:

It also explains why Rabin was murdered by Palestinian extremists and not right-wing Israelis. It explains why [the Palestinians attack so much](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/gaza-ceasefire-violations) and force Israeli forces to shell kids on beaches, or to flatten whole blocks and a hospital. Palestinians use human shields, you see, the Hannibal directive has nothing to do with it ever, and don't ask for sources either, while ignoring the instances of the IDF forcing families to stay in houses they occupy. They spray skunk water to calm people down, and they ""map"" the population by having everybody get up in the middle of the night to be photographed to give people a sense of what it's like to have dignity. [Undercover agents throwing stones](http://972mag.com/watch-israeli-undercover-agents-shoot-unarmed-boy-at-point-blank-range/112474/) are really the only way to blend in with these hateful Palestinians.

And of coures, people like [Stav Shaffir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3Pwjyt8bM) or [Max Blumenthal](http://www.alternet.org/world/painting-palestinians-nazis-netanyahu-incites-wave-vigilante-violence) are just full of it, anyway. They just hate those Israelis who want nothing but annex land peacefully. Noam Chomsky and Normal Finkelstein obviousy loathe themselves, and so on.

Seriously though, the people who dream of ""Greater Israel"" and the people who want to ""free ALL Palestine"" as they euphemistically put it, are two sides of the same coin, and they feed off each other. Peace has nothing to do with it. And I agree, neither does stabbing people have to do with ""resistance"", when I say two sides of the same coin I mean that. But when two people fuck up, and you all group around one of them and declare the other a saint, then even regardless of who occupies who and military power, it's just common decency to concentrate on what is being glossed over, not so much on what everybody and their dog is parroting already. It's not like I'm not familiar with PalWatch and what they point out, or distorted or faked stuff AKA ""Pallywood"", and how people just pass that on without thinking. That's all gross and stupid and reckless, and no doubt often racist. It certainly proudly displays tribal thinking, one group good, other bad, to be exaggerated infinitely.

But neither of the crimes and BS in certain camps on each ""side"" excuse the other else. If you think one side is pure you're on crack. The people on each side who are for human rights and international law are the closest to that, but they don't exactly get much attention now do they. People prefer to talk about the ""antisemitic Islamofascists"" or the ""child eating Zionazis"", shades of grey are for traitors.",-3,cwcq5hx

the people dreaming with ""free all Palestine"" are openly violent in their intention.

settlements mean nothing, if the Palestinian side would have accepted have a jewish community in his territory the settlement would have lose all importance, they are only relevant because Palestine does not want jews in his territory; there are arab villages in israel and they are not making noise about it.

the murder of Rabin and the murder of Sadat have the same meaning...but in Sadat's case both side still move toward peace.

the cease fire still enforce the blockade so israel still can shoot at people trying to break it.

Hamas use human shields, and told people to stay in their houses ignoring any warning.

citation on the pictures in the middle of the night.

undercover agents act like the people in which they are undercover.

Max Blumenthal surely hate israelis; Stav was elected by israelis that support her vission, Chomsky and Finkelstein want a morally superior Israel, none of those care about what happen in Ramallah, and so on.

military power means nothing in who is right and who is wrong.

every group of people living in difficult circumstances use tribal thinking to be safe, not everybody have the luxury of aircraftcarrires or living miles away the danger.

humans right and international law is just a tool, and they are used by everyone ""antisemitic Islamofascists"" and ""child eating Zionazis"".",4,cwd1tft

Ukraine hasn't just been 'holding out,' Ukraine has done more damage militarily to Russia **THAN AFGHANISTAN DID**. In literally 1/10th the time.

And Russia isn't going to use Nukes, period, the leader that gives that order would be shot before it ever made it to the people with the power to actually push the buttons. So that really eliminates the one advantage Russia has over Ukraine.

Plus, given Putin has Leukemia, we really only have to wait maybe a year, maybe two depending on how badly sanctions are cutting off medical supplies, before he's dead.

Kissinger isn't pragmatic, he's a fascist piece of dogshit that should be dragged through the streets naked tied to a high-torque truck on a particularly high grip asphalt.

He is one of the worst living human beings left on the planet. I hate Putin, but Putin wishes he was half the monster Henry Kissinger is.

Nuclear missiles he’s certainly smart enough and had enough power long   
enough to do so.

Because the vast glut of the missiles were built during a time where computer networking just didn't exist, and secondly the cost of the infrastructure for that would be so massive that even the US, that spends significantly more than Russia on weapons, doesn't have those capabilities.

More importantly, you might worship Putin's cock like he's god on Earth, but you're in a pretty rarefied group. Putin's inner circle use him to make money, they act as yes men that do not have any oversight, and this goes far down the chain, hence the very real possibility Putin thought he could take Ukraine in 3 days, despite his military not having enough equipment to take Ukraine at all.
