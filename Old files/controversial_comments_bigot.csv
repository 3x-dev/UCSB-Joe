Of course all of this was predictable when we legislated how private people ought to behave, giving them a source of resentment to fight against.  We should have left all private discrimination legal, so the bigots had nothing to blame but themselves.  Now they can easily find examples of unfairness, enabled by law, that justify that resentment.  For example, how public schools now let many disciplinary violations pass unpunished because of claims of racism, when many have seen first hand that the differences in white/black punishment rates were tightly aligned with differences in white/black behavior, and claims of bias were largely unfounded (at least in my mid Atlantic city).

Also the community is a lot less tight-knit and people are not incentivized to stand up for each other.

>Laura Dern smirking at Po for being a ""fly-boy,"" and refusing to tell him that she had a plan

Calling him a fly boy? How is that woke, but calling Han a Scruffy Nerf Herder is not? That's the same thing. As far as refusing to tell him the plan, apparently, you didn't watch the entire movie or were upset by a female character outranking a male character. Like, Poe literally disobeyed orders and then went on to commit mutiny, but he's not being allowed into the inner circle is not reasonable?

>Rose declaring that stampeding animals through the casino was worth it even though they'd failed their mission, and then her stopping the attack on the New Death Star because ""We're going to win through love"" or whatever she said.

I mean, damn, her back story is being poor and a servant to the rich people at the casino, but it doesn't make sense that she would think the stampeding animals weren't worth it?

Stopping the attack on the ""New Death Star,"" I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to as there wasn't anything quite like a ""New Death Star"" in the Last Jedi. Are you referring to Snoke's ship? That's more like Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer. Or are you talking about the battering ram machine that was going to be used to get into the base? Yeah, it wasn't ""win through love."" it was literally about not sacrificing oneself needlessly. EVEN if it was true, Luke did something similar for his dad. 

> I hated this movie, but if I said so online, people assume it's because of bigotry.

I can understand why after seeing your reasoning. Either you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire franchise, or you didn't actually fully watch the movie. Judging by your descriptions, the common denominators are that female characters were in positions of authority over the male characters or made a decision that went against them. So, yeah, you pretty sufficiently described your views as being in misogyny.  If you don't like the movie, cool, no movie is for everyone. But your complaints seem focused on the fact they're women, even when there was either an explanation or has been done by a male without complaint from you in a different Star Wars movie.

i agree that some people would have still complained about the main character being a woman. but those people are idiots that shouldn't be listened to. it is clear to me that galadriel was written the way that she was because of a diversity agenda, because she was already a strong woman just not in the way modern media depicts them. these writers are clearly trying to appeal to people who don't watch the show, and you need an incredible amount of mental gymnastics to not see it.",4,kifuajk

That's your issue. Fly boy is often a term to refer to pilots. You're not helping your ""I'm not a misogynist/bigot case."" Also, Leia was a princess/senator as well as a leader in the rebellion. Solo was technically under her.

>No, it doesn't, because she's supposed to be focusing on saving the rebellion. 

People can focus on more than one thing. Women and men both focus on multiple things at once. For example, the mission failed, and that sucked but the stampede was related to their escape.

>Yes, that, where she collided with Finn's vehicle. And it wasn't needless. By all accounts, it was their best chance to survive.

By neglecting the theme of Holdo's sacrifice, the entirety of the film, and honestly, the entire sequel trilogy, hope?  Sacrifice only to give other people hope. If his sacrifice took out that battering ram for lack of better words, there would be another one right behind it. That wouldn't have taken out the entire first-order attack group. So, he would die and the same result would occur.

>Look, what it comes down to is this: Star Wars is not a feminine series.

Translation: No girls allowed.

>It's a series with some great women characters, including Rey, but they're women who act masculine. They kick ass. 

Right, because women are weak creatures that should remain barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen? Because that is what you come off as believing with that last statement. Perhaps this is why you're being called a misogynist and/or bigot.

>The heroes in Star Wars don't win through cleverness or understanding or really even brains. 

What? You're joking, right?

>They win through fighting ability and connection with The Force, i.e., through stoicism.

Except when Luke understood the conflict in his father and believed in him and encouraged Vader to seek redemption and return to the light.  

And Palpatine totally won with cleverness as well as connection to the force

>through stoicism.

The Jedi's stoicism led to their downfall. Their disconnection with their feelings prevented them from stopping Anakin's journey to become Vader. Their stoicism led to their arrogance, and that is why they were blind to the rising dark side Palpatine brought on. Stoicism led them to be unable to death with the effects war has on the person, which is why the clone wars severely damaged the Jedi's connection with the force.


>I loved the Benoit Blanc movies and both of those featured a woman of color triumphing over people who were rich, white, or both. Because that's what those movies were about. But not every movie is about inclusivity or diversity. That's where the complaint lies.

You've failed to show how these movies were about inclusivity or diversity, just complaints that women can't be stoic because that's a masculine trait and women can't have masculine traits, right? It's too bad that one of the religions that both the sith and jedi borrow from is Taoism. Why is this relevant now?  Because one of Taoisms' most sacred symbols, the yinyang. Yin, which implies dark and feminine, and Yang has light and masculine. But, there is always a little light in the dark and a little dark in the light. A little masculine in the feminine, a little feminine in the masculine. Since, as you put it, stoicism and fighting ability is masculine traits and is something the series routinely shows, a Jedi doesn't require to demonstrated her feminine side to push the plot forward, and may also hinder the plot, if you keep your culture's gender roles intact and apply them to the Star Wars universe. Considering female jedi have been well established in the series (courtesy of the prequels and the Clone Wars series).

Basically, the only thing that's being pushed here is your own worldview on others.

Also, as a final note, I thought the movies suck (except Force Awakens, that was cool), but not because Rey is girlboss and my masculinity feels threatened, but because they tried to put too many plots into the Last Jedi, and ""Somehow Palpatine returned"" is enough to describe the issues with Rise of Skywalker. The gender of Rey had no bearing on it. And frankly, it would have worked (or, in this case, failed) regardless of her gender because being a Jedi is an androgynous position.

As in CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. They aren’t gullible, they know exactly why they are voting for trump. 

If every trump supporter is gullible, then are you saying every anti-trump person are these sophisticated and informed voters who are able to read between the lines of all political BS? Face it, we’re all being fed bull shit on both sides of the aisle and this culture war is only making things worse.

However, who the DNC messages towards is pretty clear.

It’s not unlike the fact that the mainstream right does not directly vocalize hostility towards LGBT or minorities. The real bigot is a minority.

But who the RNC does and doesn’t message towards is pretty clear.

It’s the same thing. You might say “but xyz laws about LGBT” by Republicans in some states. Then I’ll also point to reparations explorations by California, various racial AA programs in academia, and immigration advocacy that undermines blue collar negotiating power.

It’s not different in the end.",3,kih5qri
