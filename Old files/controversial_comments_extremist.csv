Freedom of speech is way more disruptive than we're giving credit to. Being that way is absolutely not socially acceptable. But often, in certain circles, your own vision wont be socially be acceptable, so why should you?

If you're asking if I'd stop Will Smith, no?  As someone who is not related to any of the three parties involved, I am an honest bystander. What is my place to tell the comedian not to tell a joke? What is my place to tell the offended husband not to do something? If these were three people at a bar the circumstances change but I recognize they're all hollywood actors in a room full of actors. I dont know, I would actually have to be convinced that the setting plays a truly impactful change compared to the bar example but that's also just how I see it. Personal accountability starts with weighing your actions. It will end with facing a jury of your peers. No one thinks what he did is right but he was at least free enough to think what he did was actually in some deluded way, okay.

True freedom of speech is the fact that we at least can argue about the veracity of his actions because he truly had the freedom to enact on his will (pun not intended). I am not trying to muddy this even more, but now more than ever it seems right to say, there are places with way more problems in regard to freedom.

Protest is inherently disruptive to local and extended communites.  
Greta Thunberg as an activist and organizer would probably agree she herself is disruptive to some meaningful degree.   
A lot of comments seemed to ask: How can we defacto label him as right winged? He is extremist, for sure, but the flavor seems to be climate-extremist. Something that maybe makes him relate to Greta but be annoyed by her action-- creating inspiration for this video. To me, a more plausible idea is just... he's equally fed up with Climate disaster as Greta, he just is deluded, too.  
I dont agree Will or man in the OP should be so hard handed, no one would. Theyre the ones gambleing the consequences of doing that. I am just saying, in that moment, Theyre given a chance to stand on the soap box, and they fell off. Thats what politics is and always will be.

Murphy is the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism. Understanding the foreign relationship with Egypt is kinda his job. He convinced 10 other Senators to back the withholding citing that Egypt has imprisoned family members of his potential political opponent in the next election. At no time, that I have read, has any of those Senators mentioned freeing, pardoning, or extradition of Mohammed Badie. I have seen talking points in right wing circles that try to conflate the two.

I think you know very well that Israel never once offered the Palestinians a viable state. They wanted to keep the settlements, which will partition the already tiny West Bank, and offered worthless desert land in return. Secondly, they want access to the water supply of the West Bank. Thirdly, Israel refused to give back East Jerusalem, which was seized during the 1967 war and is therefore not considered part of Israel according to international law. That equates to a significant portion of the West Bank being lost with nothing of value given in return. No dignified person can accept that.

>Gaza has fixed borders, a beach front, and it had money to build a thriving economy. But instead of creating an oasis, the Palestinians voted in Hamas, a terrorist organization and it used the land to continue to terrorize Israel.

You conveniently left out the fact that Israel introduced sanctions immediately following HAMAS' election victory as a punishment, which was followed by a crippling blockade in response to HAMAS defeating FATAH during street battled when the latter attempted to overthrow it. Also, Israel prevents Gaza from developing the area. They cannot import or export anything. They wanted to build a sea and air port, and Israel refused. They cannot even use all of their farmland because it is too close to the border. On top of that, Israel bombs the hell out of the region every few years. Just what kind of oasis are you imagining? Also, you do realize that Israel shoots itself in the foot in the long-term with this kind of behavior, right? Treating human beings like that is begging for extremists elements to flourish.

>What makes you think it would be different in the West Bank? What makes you think the green line would make any difference when the Palestinians teach their children that the entire land is Palestinian and to hate the Jews?

When Israel expels your people, humiliates them, blockades them, denies their national identity, treats them like animals, allows settlers to terrorize them, and bombs them, they don't need Mickey Mouse to tell them to hate Israel. 

**Like all people, the Palestinians just want to pursue their life goals and live free of oppression. Stop the occupation, treat them like human beings *for once*, and eventually the hatred for Israel will subside.

edit for more snark:

It also explains why Rabin was murdered by Palestinian extremists and not right-wing Israelis. It explains why [the Palestinians attack so much](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/gaza-ceasefire-violations) and force Israeli forces to shell kids on beaches, or to flatten whole blocks and a hospital. Palestinians use human shields, you see, the Hannibal directive has nothing to do with it ever, and don't ask for sources either, while ignoring the instances of the IDF forcing families to stay in houses they occupy. They spray skunk water to calm people down, and they ""map"" the population by having everybody get up in the middle of the night to be photographed to give people a sense of what it's like to have dignity. [Undercover agents throwing stones](http://972mag.com/watch-israeli-undercover-agents-shoot-unarmed-boy-at-point-blank-range/112474/) are really the only way to blend in with these hateful Palestinians.

And of coures, people like [Stav Shaffir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3Pwjyt8bM) or [Max Blumenthal](http://www.alternet.org/world/painting-palestinians-nazis-netanyahu-incites-wave-vigilante-violence) are just full of it, anyway. They just hate those Israelis who want nothing but annex land peacefully. Noam Chomsky and Normal Finkelstein obviousy loathe themselves, and so on.

Seriously though, the people who dream of ""Greater Israel"" and the people who want to ""free ALL Palestine"" as they euphemistically put it, are two sides of the same coin, and they feed off each other. Peace has nothing to do with it. And I agree, neither does stabbing people have to do with ""resistance"", when I say two sides of the same coin I mean that. But when two people fuck up, and you all group around one of them and declare the other a saint, then even regardless of who occupies who and military power, it's just common decency to concentrate on what is being glossed over, not so much on what everybody and their dog is parroting already. It's not like I'm not familiar with PalWatch and what they point out, or distorted or faked stuff AKA ""Pallywood"", and how people just pass that on without thinking. That's all gross and stupid and reckless, and no doubt often racist. It certainly proudly displays tribal thinking, one group good, other bad, to be exaggerated infinitely.

But neither of the crimes and BS in certain camps on each ""side"" excuse the other else. If you think one side is pure you're on crack.

Now of course Israel is a state and anything the army does is ""justified"" in order to defend themselves.

You neglect to mention why there were fantatical Jews in the first place. Need I remind you about the ethnic cleansing in Europe at the time? Well probably not but you do not seem to know about the similar attempt by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The difference with the Holocaust in Europe and the attempted one in Arabia is the arabs weren't as industrialized as the Germans and the Jewish people fought back. No side is  without fault and both sides have their fanatics.

>A reasonable person would see that there is little between Jews and Palestinians. Both want the land to be theirs. Both have extremist factions who will do whatever it takes to get what they want and both have perfectly decent citizens who crave nothing more than peace and stability.

At this late stage I would agree. The Holocaust is long over and the Arabs that believe in the destruction of Jews are week and make pathetic attempts to attack, vise versa you have the appalling behaviour by some settlers as well whom seem to have very similar motives. At least nowadays we have the Internet and there are moderates on both sides. Pethaps peace is just around the corner.

worldnews,3pwi22,Wave of Violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories,0,WorldNewsMods,cwb7pxf,t1_cwb63wa,[deleted],"There are big issues that make that it much more complicated for both sides. Please note all of the following are EXTREMELY general and have varied between sets of negotiation, it is just an attempt to outline the situation.

**Security Arrangements**: Israel isn't going to sign an agreement that would limit what they see as their legitimate security concerns. They don't want a Palestinian state or groups within it to be able to acquire large numbers of heavy weapons that may be used against them later (in war or terror), nor have difficulty defending themselves in a possible full scale war with their neighbours (as has happened many times before). So they often ask for continuing control of the Jordan valley for some period, borders, airspace, and so on. Of course the Palestinians do not want that as it infinges on sovereignty and is seen as an excuse for Israel to never leave certain areas, but even if the government agreed to not acquire weapons they are relatively weak and their ability to enforce that among the numerous varied groups is going to be limited.

**East Jerusalem**: The [Jerusalem Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Law) basically (if not explicitly) annexed East Jerusalem to Israel, and an undivided capital is a common rallying cry. The Palestinians consider East Jerusalem their capital. Adding to the difficulty is the Old City and especially The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, issues over which were an impetus to the current wave of violence. The area considered ""Jerusalem"" is also fairly large, and has been made into a complex web of Israeli and Palestinian areas, making disengagement difficult.

**Large Settlements and Land Swaps**: While the common image of an Israeli settlement is a few houses surrounded by fences or even a trailer on a hill, if you headed into a place like [Ariel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_(city\)) you would never know you weren't in a regular part of Israel. These major population centers would be difficult to evacuate, so the common solution is land swaps. Of course nobody can agree on quality or area of those swaps, or even whether they should be based on the 1967 lines (explicitly an armistice line from the '48 war) or not.

**Right of Return**: In theory the Palestinians have never dropped the demand for the return of those who left what would become Israel in 1948 (I'm going to consciously avoid ""fled,"" ""expelled,"" and so on here) and their descendants. This is a massive group that would shift the demographics of Israel to being an Arab majority state. While there are indications Abbas would agree to a much smaller return ([according to the Palestine Papers](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/01/25/mideast.al.jazeera.leaks/) as few as 10,000), officially they have not taken it off the table and whether the general population would agree is highly questionable.

There are of course additional issues, like water, holy places, extremists, and so on, but hopefully this illustrates why such a simple, clean break has not occured.",12,cwb63wa

Palestinian violence was increased when Palestinians had more economic opportunities. Palestinians do not kill Jews because they have nothing to lose. Palestinian leaders incite violence when it suits them. That plus a sense of entitlement combined with a culture of hate contine the conflict.

You are presuming that it is the responsibility of Israel to create jobs and a prosperous Palestinian state. You are asking Israel to act as the government of Palestinians which it has no obligation to do so.

So because not all violence in the history of Palestine was caused by settlements there must be no connection to the current violence? How is a that a good argument and why does it seem to get plastered everywhere. The settlements are *current* issue involved in the *current* violence. There are Israelis moving into heavily populated areas in Palestine, you know the place filled with all those Jew hating Palestinians, building communities, burning local crops, attacking locals and this is somehow not seen as god damn insane. No clue what world you guys live in where that makes sense.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agqi6akkc20 please tell me how the hell you could possibly think this isn't contributing to the Palestinians anger? So I'm not just using one example lets look at some others...

> Gush Emunim Underground was a militant organization that operated in 1979–1984. The organization planned attacks on Palestinian officials and the Dome of the Rock.[177][178] In 1994, Baruch Goldstein of Hebron, a member of Kach carried out the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, killing 29 Muslim worshipers and injuring 125. The attack was widely condemned by the Israeli government and Jewish community. The Palestinian leadership has accused Israel of ""encouraging and enabling"" settler violence in a bid to provoke Palestinian riots and violence in retaliation.[179] Violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers against Palestinians constitutes terrorism according to the U.S. Department of State, and former IDF Head of Central Command Avi Mizrahi stated that such violence constitutes ""terror.""[180]
> 
> In mid-2008, a UN report recorded 222 acts of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and IDF troops compared with 291 in 2007.[181] This trend reportedly increased in 2009.[182] Maj-Gen Shamni said that the number had risen from a few dozen individuals to hundreds, and called it ""a very grave phenomenon.""[181] In 2008–2009, the defense establishment adopted a harder line against the extremists.[182] This group responded with a tactic dubbed ""price tagging,"" vandalizing Palestinian property whenever police or soldiers were sent in to dismantle outposts.[183] From January through to September 2013, 276 attacks by settlers against Palestinians were recorded.[184]
> 
> Leading religious figures in the West Bank have harshly criticized these tactics. Rabbi Menachem Froman of Tekoa said that ""Targeting Palestinians and their property is a shocking thing, (...) It's an act of hurting humanity. (...) This builds a wall of fire between Jews and Arabs.""[185] The Yesha Council and Hanan Porat also condemned such actions.[186] Other rabbis have been accused of inciting violence against non-Jews.[187] In response to settler violence, the Israeli government said that it would increase law enforcement and cut off aid to illegal outposts.[188] Some settlers are thought to lash out at Palestinians because they are ""easy victims.""[189] The United Nations accused Israel of failing to intervene and arrest settlers suspected of violence.[190] In 2008, Haaretz wrote that ""Israeli society has become accustomed to seeing lawbreaking settlers receive special treatment and no other group could similarly attack Israeli law enforcement agencies without being severely punished.""[191]
> 
> In September 2011, settlers vandalized a mosque and an army base. They slashed tires and cut cables of 12 army vehicles and sprayed graffiti.[192] In November 2011, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) in the Palestinian territories published a report on settler violence that showed a significant rise compared to 2009 and 2010. The report covered physical violence and property damage such as uprooted olive trees, damaged tractors and slaughtered sheep. The report states that 90% of complaints filed by Palestinians have been closed without charge.[193]
> 
> According to EU reports, Israel has created an ""atmosphere of impunity"" for Jewish attackers, which is seen as tantamount to tacit approval by the state. In the West Bank, Jews and Palestinians live under two different legal regimes and it is difficult for Palestinians to lodge complaints, which must be filed in Hebrew in Israeli settlements.[194]
> 
> The 27 ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union published a report in May 2012 strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and denouncing ""continuous settler violence and deliberate provocations against Palestinian civilians.""[195] The report by all EU ministers called ""on the government of Israel to bring the perpetrators to justice and to comply with its obligations under international law.""[195]
> 
> In July 2014, a day after the burial of three murdered Israeli teens. Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian, was forced into a car by 3 Israeli settlers on an East Jerusalem street.[196] His family immediately reported the fact to Israeli Police who located his charred body a few hours later at Givat Shaul in the Jerusalem Forest. Preliminary results from the autopsy suggested that he was beaten and burnt while still alive.[197][198][199][200] The murder suspects explained the attack as a response to the June abduction and murder of three Israeli teens.[201][202] The murders contributed to a breakout of hostilities in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[203] In July 2015, a similar incident occurred where Israeli settlers made an arson attack on two Palestinian houses, one of which was empty; however, the other was occupied, resulting in the burning to death of a Palestinian infant; the four other members of his family were evacuated to the hospital suffering serious injuries.[204] These two incidents received condemnation from the United States, European Union and even the IDF.[205] The European Union criticized Israel for ""failing to protect the Palestinian population"".[206]

Man there's no way that this stuff could possibly piss off Palestinians, why won't they stop being so dramatic? It's only murder and destruction of their crops/land, but they didn't exist when other violence happened so clearly it's not an issue.

No, the point is that claiming the violence is the result of the settlements is wrong. There would be violence even if there were no settlements. How do I know this? Because there were decades of violence before the settlements. The settlements are a red herring.

Most of the major settlements are rebuilt Jewish towns that were ethnically cleansed by the arabs in 1948. Gush Etzion was on land bought by Jews. You are trying to claim that the Jews do not have a right to rebuild there after they recapture the land that was stolen from them? But like I said, the arabs started a war, lost a war, tried another war, lost another war, tried some more, lost some more, and they have had multiple opportunities to make peace. They don't want peace in the sense of coexistence. They want peace in the sense of a Judenrein middle east. If the Israelis want to expand outward into the disputed land, I am all for it. Peace isn't going to be achieved, so why should they bother pretending? It is also worth noting that the land claimed as palestinian was actually state owned ottoman land. It was never independent and most palestinians living on it were renters. Let me ask you, if you are renting a property and the landlord goes belly up, do you automatically become the owner of that property? No? Well same goes for the palestinians. They had their chance to set up a state when the British Mandate ended and the land was being appropriated but they chose war and now they have to live with the consequences of losing that war.

You talk about Israeli extremists, and you know what the difference is? The Israeli government condemns their actions and punishes perpetrators of violence. Find me a palestinian leader who will condemn the acts of the palestinian murderers both in english and in arabic. Abbas is personally responsible for the current violence by making inflammatory comments. Israel does far more to try keeping the peace than the palestinians and is far more likely to punish violent Israeli extremists than the PA is to punish murderers. I mean, they rename streets after the murdering swine, hold parties in their honor, and pay their families a reward for their actions. Hardly the actions of a partner in peace.
