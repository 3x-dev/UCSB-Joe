And that would be just fine.. if they weren't doing this almost across the entire board. Practically every film they make these days is like this, in every franchise or IP they own.

In this specific case, intent will be impossible to prove because of how capable Israel is of killing and how relatively little killing is happening.

If I am wrong, it will be because they very well might be intending to destroy the group through means other than death, i.e. the destruction of most buildings on the strip. But that will not work either because the tunnels make pretty much everything a viable target.

In the holocaust, 2 out of every three Jews were killed. That is 66% of all Jews.

In Gaza, .04 people out of every three has been killed. That is 4% of one person out of every three. 1.5 million Gazans would be dead if these two situations were the same. Many more than 30,000 would be dead if they were similar.

Israel’s bombing of Gaza will almost for sure never be defined as genocide by any official measures. For one, they were attacked and are fighting a defensive war. I agree that they are not fighting an existential war, as they may try to have you believe, but still.

Secondly, in a tiny strip of land filled with 2.2M people, they have managed to not kill roughly 2.2M of them (I do not mean to discount the horrific loss of life, likely about 30,000 people, right?). The loss of life involved in Gaza equates to something a little more than a rounding error (again, attack me if you must, I am not trying to be offensive, just trying to demonstrate to you how unlike the holocaust this is) or specifically 1.4%.

Anyone who believes Israel is deliberately killing Palestinians with the intent to destroy the group has got to be off their rocker. That is not to discount the fact that many examples of deliberate killing of Palestinians has been perpetuated by Israel, which is very sad and I am upset about. Just to say, with the asymmetric military capabilities involved, if Israel wanted Palestinians to all be dead…we would be dealing with something else entirely.

The sexual crimes imputed to the Palestinian side are based on Israeli witnesses, sometimes on second or third degree, many of which were proven false. Some were completely absurd btw, like one recently about a woman who was allegedly found with semen from 67 different DNA. Which leads me to the point: there is a huge sexual problem in Israel.

edit for more snark:

It also explains why Rabin was murdered by Palestinian extremists and not right-wing Israelis. It explains why [the Palestinians attack so much](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/gaza-ceasefire-violations) and force Israeli forces to shell kids on beaches, or to flatten whole blocks and a hospital. Palestinians use human shields, you see, the Hannibal directive has nothing to do with it ever, and don't ask for sources either, while ignoring the instances of the IDF forcing families to stay in houses they occupy. They spray skunk water to calm people down, and they ""map"" the population by having everybody get up in the middle of the night to be photographed to give people a sense of what it's like to have dignity. [Undercover agents throwing stones](http://972mag.com/watch-israeli-undercover-agents-shoot-unarmed-boy-at-point-blank-range/112474/) are really the only way to blend in with these hateful Palestinians.

And of coures, people like [Stav Shaffir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3Pwjyt8bM) or [Max Blumenthal](http://www.alternet.org/world/painting-palestinians-nazis-netanyahu-incites-wave-vigilante-violence) are just full of it, anyway. They just hate those Israelis who want nothing but annex land peacefully. Noam Chomsky and Normal Finkelstein obviousy loathe themselves, and so on.

Seriously though, the people who dream of ""Greater Israel"" and the people who want to ""free ALL Palestine"" as they euphemistically put it, are two sides of the same coin, and they feed off each other. Peace has nothing to do with it. And I agree, neither does stabbing people have to do with ""resistance"", when I say two sides of the same coin I mean that. But when two people fuck up, and you all group around one of them and declare the other a saint, then even regardless of who occupies who and military power, it's just common decency to concentrate on what is being glossed over, not so much on what everybody and their dog is parroting already. It's not like I'm not familiar with PalWatch and what they point out, or distorted or faked stuff AKA ""Pallywood"", and how people just pass that on without thinking. That's all gross and stupid and reckless, and no doubt often racist. It certainly proudly displays tribal thinking, one group good, other bad, to be exaggerated infinitely.

How many Palestinian spokesmen vs Israeli spokesmen were there? Next to nil.

> If the Palestinians Stopped murdering JEWS then there would be no reason for your list.

The Palestinian resistance movement has a long tradition of non-violent resistance inspired by Gandhian principles. Numerous villages hold weekly demonstrations to protest Israeli restrictions on movement and access to their land. These demonstrationss are almost always countered by violent force utilized by IDF forces. This includes tear gas, rubber bullets, live ammunition and ""skunk guns"". The [protests](http://www.pbs.org/pov/5brokencameras/) over Israel's separation barrier in one village, Bil'in were documented in a film titled [5 Broken Cameras.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/17/1415689/www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_93nOqwmhU)
Numerous unarmed activists have been killed by IDF forces during demonstrations. Poorly organized demonstrations also routinely degenerate into rock-throwing. An illuminating incident occured during the Ferguson protests, when numerous Palestinian activists shared tactics, including on [dealing with tear gas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11036190/Palestinians-tweet-tear-gas-advice-to-protesters-in-Ferguson.html), with those in Ferguson. Commentators also noted that the militarization of police responses to protests in the US [may be influenced](http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/routine-emergencies/.premium-1.611564) by training they receive on free trips to Israel. Pro-Israel organizations have made explicit attempts to [counter](http://www.adl.org/press-center/c/dont-compare-ferguson-and-palestine.html) any association between Palestinian and American social justice movements.

The heavy handed approach of Israeli authorities in dealing with Palestinian protest movements [became difficult to ignore](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/opinion/roger-cohen-the-shared-destiny-of-israel-and-gaza.html) during the first intifada, with an official policy [encouraging](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/12/world/israel-declines-to-study-rabin-tie-to-beatings.html) Israeli police and soldiers to [""break the bones""](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/the-return-of-ancient-times/378247/) of protestors.

In general, the noviolent aspect of the resistance gets overshadowed by more violent factions. 

>  stop glorifying murderers, stop naming streets after murderers,

First off, every place has its share of unthinking assholes, some have more than other places. The correct response is whether it is ever appropriate to punish, oppress or otherwise infringe on the rights of a population in retribution for the words of a few. Or whether words alone can ever justify punishment.
The argument is specious since (some) Israelis are also guilty of indulging in celebrations at the suffering of Palestinians. This started in 1948 with celebrations over the creation of Israel, painfully impervious to the fact that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced to create the new state, and they were prevented by the entire Israeli state apparatus from returning to their homes and property. This is why Palestinians characterize Israel's ""independence"" as the Nakba (catastrophe).

Israelis have been [gathering at hilltops](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israelgaza-conflict-sderot-cinema-image-shows-israelis-with-popcorn-and-chairs-cheering-as-missiles-strike-palestinian-targets-9602704.html) in Sderot to [watch and celebrate](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/israelis-cheer-gaza-bombing) bombs being dropped on Gaza, fully aware of the death toll these bombs cause. This has been [going on, at least since 2009](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/middleeast/israelis-watch-bombs-drop-on-gaza-from-front-row-seats.html). Young Israelis took to social media to text and post statements like ""Death to Arabs"" while Gaza was being bombed. The ire is not reserved for ""Arabs"", far-right rallies in Israel are peppered with [chants](http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.606937)  of [""Death to Leftists"".](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/opinion/how-israel-silences-dissent.html)

Very senior Israeli leaders are also on record as saying and doing vile things, Naftali Bennett has been in the government for years. He's responsible for killing 106 civilians sheltering in a UN facility and [boasts about it](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bennett-under-fire-for-comments-about-killing-Arabs-321467) saying “I have killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there is no problem with that.” Avigdor Lieberman (as Foreign Minister) said Arab citizens of Israel [should be beheaded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/10/israeli-foreign-minister-says-disloyal-arabs-should-be-beheaded/). Ayelet Shaked, the current Justice Minister has approvingly quoted statements [describing Palestinian children as ""little snakes""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/07/israels-new-justice-minister-considers-all-palestinians-to-be-the-enemy/). And then you have Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, terrorists both, who set bombs in markets/buses/hotels to kill civilians, who both became Prim Ministers of Israel. And to round out the trinity, we have another Israeli PM, Ariel Sharon, a mass murderer several times over.

> stop lying to children and teaching them to murder Jews, stop naming infants, ""Knife of Jerusalem""

You may see a picture of a Palestinian child holding a gun, or an image of a young boys in a ""Hamas training camp"". This is sometimes followed by ""I dare you to find any other religion that does this"". Sadly, a lot of people are willing to let young children handle lethal weapons. A google image search for ""Israeli toddlers with guns"" will demonstrate that.

Some [militant](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/israeli-terrorists-born-in-the-usa.html) Israelis actively venerate Jewish terrorists, in particular Baruch Goldstein. This includes incidents where children's songs are sung [extolling Baruch Goldstein](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3857671,00.html) or [dressing children as Goldstein, handing them toy rifles and marching them](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8213.html) down the streets of Hebron on Purim. Goldstein killed 29 people praying in Hebron's Ibrahimi mosque on Purim/Ramadan in February 1994.

You may hear the counter-argument that this is just a small minority of [radical](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/31/among-the-settlers) settlers. Yet monuments to terrorists abound in Israel. Numerous streets and parks are named for [Menachem Begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_50_(Israel)), [Yitzhak Shamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_1_(Israel)) and [Ariel Sharon](http://www.jpost.com/Enviro-Tech/Ariel-Sharon-Park-transforms-eyesore-into-paradise), who were all terrorists or mass-murderers. Numerous other streets are named after the [members of the Irgun/Lehi terrorist groups](http://forward.com/opinion/318420/the-problem-with-netanyahus-response-to-jewish-terror/). Some Israelis are well aware of how Palestinians see [such names.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ex-idf-chief-s-widow-rejects-naming-east-jerusalem-street-after-him-1.5751)

Israel has issued postage stamps for Sharon, Shamir, Begin, and for [Avraham Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Stern), the leader of the Stern Gang (Lehi), whose philosophy was so radical he broke away from Irgun (among other things, he wanted to [ally with Nazi Germany](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Abraham-Stern-Israels-own-revolutionary-339431) against the British occupation of Palestine). He openly [advocated terrorism](https://books.google.com/books?id=GTtFAV-fIEAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false), yet hundreds of Israelis [flock to his grave](http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-rebel-remembered/) every year and there's a town named for him. Lehi's views towards terrorism were [articulated](https://books.google.com/books?id=I1sXp8D80V0C&lpg=PA182&ots=xx5ArkYbA0&pg=PA182#v=onepage&q&f=false) in their newsletter:

> Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can disqualify terrorism as a means of combat. We are very far from having any moral qualms as far as our national war goes. We have before us the command of the Torah, whose morality surpasses that of any other body of laws in the world: ""Ye shall blot them out to the last man."" But first and foremost, terrorism is for us a part of the political battle being conducted under the present circumstances, and it has a great part to play: speaking in a clear voice to the whole world, as well as to our wretched brethren outside this land, it proclaims our war against the occupier. We are particularly far from this sort of hesitation in regard to an enemy whose moral perversion is admitted by all.

United States also has arguments over symbols. Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer and Andrew Jackson have many places named after them and yet they all engaged in deplorable acts. Many of these monuments deserve to be removed. Yet, this has no bearing on the rights of Americans, and it should not have any bearing on the rights of Palestinians either.
