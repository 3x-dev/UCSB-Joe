changemyview,18ftr93,CMV: People who think having sex with multiple people is empowering are useful idiots,22,Brave_Newspaper_4747,kcwb7q6,t1_kcwap51,Brave_Newspaper_4747,"That's more of fighting against homophobia that's empowering, not the sex bit. I'd argue you could get the same results by holding hands or something. My point being that you not being ashamed of who you are could probably be achieved through other means. 

&#x200B;

At the end of the day I don't care who you bang, I mean so long as it's consensual and legal by all means go for it. You're not any less or more of a person by shagging someone.

That being said I'm glad you don't feel ashamed of who you are.",-40,kcwap51

And just because I have other means available to me doesn’t mean casual sex can’t also be a source of empowerment.

Or by speaking to “other means” are you suggesting there can only be one source of empowerment?

Are you arguing that casual sex *isn’t* empowering or arguing that people should choose other options that you view as more acceptable?",57,kcwb7q6
changemyview,199unuw,CMV: The MAGA crowd is a cult full of hate,0,Overall-Put-1165,kihb01f,t1_kigi6bj,McBloggenstein,"It’s one thing to be gullible from his lies, but they have to already like him to be willing to fall for it all. 

The thing I wrestle with is if you’re a hardcore MAGA then he must be “speaking to you” on some level. Well, his entire messaging involves nothing but **us vs them**, manifesting in xenophobia, racism, homophobia, Islamophobia, controlling women, democrat-aphobia, etc. That’s it. I’m not saying his supporters are all of those, but more and more you get the feeling they are at least one of those. How else is it that he “speaks to you”? To me that’s not a good person.",1,kigi6bj
