changemyview,17yrbm5,"CMV: People who use the word ""herstory"" are fucking idiots.",69,RealFee1405,k9w2lch,t3_17yrbm5,gate18,"I love the word!

History has been told from a male point of view and the word ""herstory"" has originated as a critique to that. It was coined by Robin Morgan in 1968.

Without mixing sexism or politics, a lot of people hate the evolution of language, they hate play on words, and they think others that don't adhere to the ""standard"" are ""fucking stupid"". There are old woman, at least in United Kingdom, who write letters to different organizations when they see language not used the way it's supposed to.

So, in a way, surely you are a ""fucking idiot"" to someone else for the way you use language. **I know, you think that your objections are valid unlike those old hags**

> Using ""herstory"" is based on ignorance and stupidity and false presumptions about etymology that could easily be reversed by a Google search

Secondly, feminists (a bunch of people with a huge range of interests) aren't ignorant, **though by now even stupid people can google search**, they know what you know. So it's not what you think but it's a play on words to **highlight the actual fact** that history is written by men (and the powerful)

As with many slogans, They want you to think. In my opinion, even your rant (though it doesn't look like it) is positive. 50 people might agree with you and 1 might start to think about the way history is written.

At the end of the day, words are made up. Why was the word ""history"" taken from France? It could have been taken by anywhere else and no one would give a shit today. But surely back then, some person, said ""why should we take words from the French, which not ...""

Making up words that make people talk about the issue is genius - even if they butcher the topic at hand

Black Lives Matter vs stop killing black people. A lot of racists came of out the woodworks. A lot of people willingly prevented themselves from going beyond the slogan...  ""I've been saying it but no one believed me, Blacks are hateful. Now look, only black lives matter""

If instead they just said ""history from a woman's perspective"" - meh. 

I'm sure they were using that even before 1968. ""A room of one's own? Meh, just some women writing from a woman's perspective, they just can't stop playing the victim, they don't realize how good they have it. You know we have 10 men sleeping in the same room and she writes about a woman needing a room of her own and £500, the fucking cheek""

Herstory makes you think or rant. Better than just taking the status quo without making a sound",3,17yrbm5

Now is it actively hurting white men yet, not really. The added burning is still fairly benign. But they way things are going i would say give it time.

I’ve gotten a lot of death/violence threats walking down the street minding my own business that were from someone of another race and mention either my race or the race of the aggressor.

I’m unaware of anyone I know personally who has gotten a similar number.

When I tell other people about it, they frequently try to convince me that the explicitly racist threats I received aren’t racist OR that I need to consider and empathize with the socioeconomic factors that would lead to someone having so much violent hate for white men.

Or I have ppl coming out of the woodwork to tell me ‘that isn’t racism’ because a certain subset of ppl really like to enforce a highly specific definition of racism ONLY when the victim is white and the aggressor is not.

IMO white ppl aren’t distinct in the quantity of racism they have directed at them.  

BUT the experience of being gaslit by ppl trying to convince you that the violently racist threat just directed at you should be an opportunity to consider the feelings of the person who interrupted your day to tell you he wanted to kill you is, so far as I can tell, unique.

I do see more jokes about men in some Instagram posts, but I also see plenty of men making kitchen jokes on posts by women doing random things (usually gym posts). I think for jokes it is way more dependent on your social circle and environment, which is why no one can agree what demographic is most often the butt of jokes.

However, when it comes to other forms of discrimination, white men do not face more hatred. Social media already tends to be more left leaning in general. Real life is very different. There are certain places in North America where it's common to be harassed just for being a POC/woman. This is because the hatred white men face is usually more out of jealousy or resentment due to perceived privilege, which is bad, but it doesn't lead to extremely harmful outcomes. The hatred POC face is on average much more sinister and subtle. Stereotypes about black people lead to them getting shot and searched more by police, catcalling is common for women, minority groups end up as scapegoats and get hate crimed, minority owned restaurants/shops get vandalized, looking different while taking the subway can get you harassed by mentally ill people, and more.

Social media is available for everyone to see, for an unlimited amount of time (unless the post is removed), but in person, there may be very much less people witnessing a racist action in live time and a lesser amount willing to get involved in other’s business in person. 

I would also argue that our societal opinions are molded by social media.

Imagine if the LA Riots after the Rodney King beating happened today? We would likely have widespread riots across the country like we did after the George Floyd riots and Jacob Blake riots. Social media would drive societal group think.

I believe the culture of the MAGA movement is one that is based on hate, if only because the policies espoused by the leaders in the movement (Trump, Bannon, Tucker, Hannity, etc.) are usually based on in-group/out-group ethics where the out groups tend to be minorities, the poor, LGBTQ+ people, anyone not Evangelical (with a carveout for Israel), and so forth. And when all your policies are designed to harm those out groups, that can't really be described as anything but hate.

That said, I believe there are three groups of people at play in the MAGA movement, and I believe group three is where I'd like to change your view.

First, there are the leaders who are in it to enrich themselves and grift the people below them. This would include Trump, Hannity, Tucker, and so forth. They may have mildly hate-filled views, but they aren't actually there *because* of the hate, they're there because the hate sells. If it gets them power, it gets them money, and that's their core motivation in life.

Second, there are a mix of leaders and followers who are genuinely hateful people. This would go for Bannon, Stephen Miller, Fuentes, and so forth, plus a subset of constituents who are hateful people and like that they are being given a permission structure in which to freely hate. These are people who genuinely believe that non-white, non-straight people are inferior and should have all the power of the state brought to bear to oppress them.

Third and finally, there are the remainder which I believe is a majority of Republican voters today. These people are not specifically hate-filled. These are the bystanders that watch a mob lynch an innocent man and don't specifically cheer or grab the rope but also don't do anything to stop them. I don't think any of them would take active steps to harm a minority, a member of the LGBTQ+, someone with a disability, a Muslim or an atheist, etc. I would say these are the people that would quickly say ""No, I'm not racist, I have a black friend."" 

I don't think these people have the same hate as the first (playacted) or second (genuine) groups. It is absolutely the case that their political action -- that is, voting for the Republican party -- empowers hateful actions to take place through policy and sometimes actual state action (kids in cages, etc.). But none of them, given the opportunity, would grab the arm of a brown child and rip them away from their parent at the border. In fact, they might feel a bit of shame if they were in proximity to it being done.

It is the distance, in fact, that keeps the shame away. They don't happen to know a gay couple and they might turn their nose up at it, but it's not like *they* would go protest a gay wedding. They've seen the textbooks and *they* would never be the ones screaming at Ruby Bridges as she tries to walk into the school in Little Rock.

I don't know that I could effectively articulate what it is that they are filled with that isn't hate. Perhaps it's more a lack of empathy, or an abundance of apathy, or an ample dose of denial. If there is any hate there, it's more a byproduct of the above.

I think it's easy to see the rallies and the marches and the MAGA hats and see a nation half-full of abhorrent people. But I'd be willing to bet the average Trump voter filling up their gas tank in Tuscaloosa, Alabama isn't daily or even monthly engaging in activities of harm toward their fellow man.

Pointing it out shows that people have options:

1. vote/ advocate
2. run for election
3. move

You hold a minority view in a majority opposition area. A representative government cannot represent all positions on a given issue. You don't have to like it, but to suggest it is an indictment of the opposition party is reductive. If you value your positions more than the majority in which you are surrounded by, the only logical recourse then is to move. If you think SF is ""leftist absurdity"", then you likely share common values with places that institute ""rightist absurdity"".

As far as your indictment of higher education, I see your talking points and know very well where they come from, so I will address them:

1. Let's not forget that the discrimination in admission scandal was because Harvard's methods suppressed the chance of Asian-American candidates being accepted, in favor of white, hispanic, and black candidates. This demonstrated inherent bias in qualitative measuring of student attributes. They were wrong because such bias violates federal law, but not for the reasons you suggest, unless you are suggesting that Asian American suppression is the goal of ""the Left"".
2. The student letter did not voice support for Hamas. It blamed Israel for the attack, the rise of Hamas, and called to end the slaughter of innocent Palestinians. Yes, naive and oversimplification of the conflict, but protected speech nonetheless. The talking heads that suggest Harvard was protecting students who voiced support for a terrorist organization is equally appalling as is labeling anything that challenges Israel's policies, actions, and methods as ""anti-semetic"".
3. While you may find edge cases of bullying happening on that campus, the only things I have seen are protests and counter protests amping each other up and incidents of anti-semitism. I propose that there are anti-semites in a lot of spaces in the U.S., same as racists hanging bananas or posting pictures of monkeys at black fraternities. These do not serve as examples of an institution's support for horrid behavior. Every institution has policies in place to investigate and prosecute with prejudice this type of behavior, but that would not serve the narrative. I have yet to see one case where a student alleges bullying that has not been addressed by any academic institution. But the headline remains.
4. Abysmal free speech rating, I somehow knew this was coming:

As irrelevant as it is to your topic, the FIRE’s College Free Speech Rankings are a self congratulating Republican echo chamber funded by the Charles Koch Institute, right winger Richard Mellon Scaife's estate, and the Bradley Foundation (conservative anti-public education group).

  
But, to address your concerns of Harvard's low rankings, lets examine why they got such a horrible score (according to FIRE):

They ""sanctioned"" 4 scholars (3 terminated) (two were denied Tenure by their peers not fired, one resigned after news caught ahold of his post that suggested ""90%+ of the Black students at Williams (another ""elite"" university) would not have been admitted were it not for their Black’ness"" (but FIRE classified is as ""forced to resign""), the last was the Dean of the Law school taking on a high profile client (Defending Harvey Weinstein) instead of focusing on being a Dean, but again, FIRE represents it as a suppression of ideological free speech.

  
Revoked an admission offer to a high schooler that made repeated racists private texts

  
Disinvited an invited guest speaker for questionable ties to an anti-trans Non-profit

  
Had an economic talk protested by students.

  
**None** of this represents that Harvard is ""anti-free speech"".

  
For the employees, they know they can speak and write as citizens but those words and actions reflect upon their employer and you can be fired for them if it affects the institution. It has nothing to do with ""free speech"" when you post lies or misinformation, especially when they use their association with Harvard to legitimize their platform. But again, none of the employees were ""fired"" for their speech.  
For prospective students, Harvard is a very selective institution. If you give them a reason to not admit you, there are 50,000 other students who are equally academically capable students who did not make problematic comments when they thought no one else was listening. I find it humorous that FIRE frames the student in question as, ""Parkland, Fla. school shooting survivor and gun rights activist Kyle Kashuv"" instead of the more accurate ""Kashuv, the right winger who considers black people ""jewish slaves"" and ""niggerjocks"" (actual statements he wrote and were the reason that Harvard considered the student not as attractive as at least one of the other 50K).  
I am an advocate of the freedom of speech. However, that right is only granted by the constitution to guarantee that the government does not infringe upon our right to speak out against the government. Not a private institution and surely not private institutions that we all voluntarily agree to be a part of. However, most academic institutions go to great lengths to protect speech.

  
All of that to say FIRE is garbage, but if you follow FIRE's logic, they should stand steadfastly behind Gay being able to say that the horrendous speech, even that written in the letter from the students, is technically protected.

There are plenty of conservative academics. They tend to be less divisive and focus on their job: research and teaching, but every now and then, they make headlines for problematic views as well while the moderates just shake their heads. But hey, lets purity test conservatives and if we don't agree with their moderate take on a given position, lets just call them RINOs.",1,kilq9ae

>Even the narrative that the settlers were willing to coexist at the founding of the nation but couldn't swing it due to Palestinian violence crumbles pretty quickly

We should be telling the world that the Zionists, since they first arrived in 1882, were intent on beating robbing and killing Palestinians from their land.

And the real fault of the Palestinians is having been much too gentle. They (or their forefathers) had 35 years (until the British arrived in 1917) to stop these stick-wielding land-grabbers.

Failure to do so is what is causing them to be so hideously punished now.

edit for more snark:

It also explains why Rabin was murdered by Palestinian extremists and not right-wing Israelis. It explains why [the Palestinians attack so much](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/gaza-ceasefire-violations) and force Israeli forces to shell kids on beaches, or to flatten whole blocks and a hospital. Palestinians use human shields, you see, the Hannibal directive has nothing to do with it ever, and don't ask for sources either, while ignoring the instances of the IDF forcing families to stay in houses they occupy. They spray skunk water to calm people down, and they ""map"" the population by having everybody get up in the middle of the night to be photographed to give people a sense of what it's like to have dignity. [Undercover agents throwing stones](http://972mag.com/watch-israeli-undercover-agents-shoot-unarmed-boy-at-point-blank-range/112474/) are really the only way to blend in with these hateful Palestinians.

And of coures, people like [Stav Shaffir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3Pwjyt8bM) or [Max Blumenthal](http://www.alternet.org/world/painting-palestinians-nazis-netanyahu-incites-wave-vigilante-violence) are just full of it, anyway. They just hate those Israelis who want nothing but annex land peacefully. Noam Chomsky and Normal Finkelstein obviousy loathe themselves, and so on.

Seriously though, the people who dream of ""Greater Israel"" and the people who want to ""free ALL Palestine"" as they euphemistically put it, are two sides of the same coin, and they feed off each other. Peace has nothing to do with it. And I agree, neither does stabbing people have to do with ""resistance"", when I say two sides of the same coin I mean that. But when two people fuck up, and you all group around one of them and declare the other a saint, then even regardless of who occupies who and military power, it's just common decency to concentrate on what is being glossed over, not so much on what everybody and their dog is parroting already. It's not like I'm not familiar with PalWatch and what they point out, or distorted or faked stuff AKA ""Pallywood"", and how people just pass that on without thinking. That's all gross and stupid and reckless, and no doubt often racist. It certainly proudly displays tribal thinking, one group good, other bad, to be exaggerated infinitely.

But neither of the crimes and BS in certain camps on each ""side"" excuse the other else. If you think one side is pure you're on crack. The people on each side who are for human rights and international law are the closest to that, but they don't exactly get much attention now do they.
