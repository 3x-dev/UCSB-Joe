While the dominant definition of feminism and original intended definition of feminism is about gender equality, that is not the only working definition. There are and have been female supremacists that have co-opted the term.

I'm not saying this an an incel or anything. From memory the woman who shot Andy Warhol was one. Obviously an unhinged person, not someone to be taken super seriously. But she did write a book about theoretical matriarchal subjugation of men that at least a few people earnestly liked.They're not particularly common, but there absolutely are people who identify as feminists who are not looking for across the board equality.

I mean, look at how fucked over women have been by the patriarchy for centuries. It's not as if there aren't gonna be any women with enough resentment to want to come out on top rather than side by side.

I'd argue these people were bad feminists and shithouse philosophical theorists, but they have been able to hold a claim over the term feminists (mainly by patriarchal media portraying them as far more common than they are as a way to demonise feminism).",6,k9v5jlj
changemyview,17yrbm5,"CMV: People who use the word ""herstory"" are fucking idiots.",65,RealFee1405,k9wprf9,t1_k9vimcm,TimeViking,"Is it, though?   If “man” is both a gender and a species, and “woman” is a gender, then that adds an extra qualifying step that separates women off from the baseline. Sure, nobody is going around twiddling their Hitler moustache literally calling women subhuman mongrels — well, apart from extremely online male communities like the “red pill” or incel umbrellas of subreddits — but it’s a linguistic feature that centers that there is a default way to be human, which is male, and an exceptional, abnormal way to exist which is unlike being an ordinary person, which is to be female.

If you went around in public calling Taylor Swift or Michelle Obama or the late Queen Elizabeth II “a man,” then the reaction wouldn’t be “ah, he’s using the inclusive term that defines all of humanity.”  They’d rightly think you were concerned overmuch with and policing those women’s femininity, because “man” and “woman” are terms that feature dense political baggage and cultural meaning beyond the OED definition.

This is of course without getting into, for the sake of brevity, the dominant historical theology of *all* of the places that feature this quirk of language, which holds that the originator of all humanity is a man from whom was begat his subservient female partner, which one could suppose might have biased someone against women at some point in the last several millennia and informed a reading of “man” that is exclusionary rather than inclusive.",2,k9vimcm

That's... that's what I said. 

That's what society does. It gives social value to those that meet the expected norms. Men are presumed to be horndogs that want to have sex. Men that aren't like that receive less social value for their behaviour when they refrain from the pursuit of women. Women receive less social value when they pursue sexual relationships with multiple men. 

You are rephrasing my point, and framing it as a disagreement. 

> a 40 year old who still lives with their parents (barring any mental or physical health issues)

That's a different movie - ""Failure to Launch"". And yes, I feel (from my perch as a 50-something that moved out when I was 22), that the negative perception of a 40 year old still living with his parents is still less than that faced by a man never having been able to connect w a woman sexually by that age. I may be wrong, and I try have an open mind. 

> people have a sense of what is normal 

And that's what lies at the heart of this issue. ""Sense of what is normal"" comes from where? We're not born with it. It's not something that we develop in a vacuum. We're taught it, bit by bit - by our peers, by our parents, and by the messaging in society. And that message, overwhelmingly, is that men that can't get women to sleep with them are losers. (That's, more or less, the core of the use of ""incel"" as an insult.) That's why those that have not been able to ever find a partner are angry - because they feel that they're being PREVENTED from being what they think of as ""normal"". They're afraid that they're being devalued because they're not ""NORMAL"". This, in turn, translates into ""I'm OWED sex from SOMEONE - just because it's NORMAL"". Men that cannot find romantic partners feel devalued, and that feeling turns into resentment. And that resentment turns into misogyny - because it's WAY easier to blame others for you not being attractive to them, than it is to actually look at yourself and say ""where am I flawed, and what can I do to work on that.""

Hell, the Washington Post just recently published an editorial (that they posted semi-anonymously) telling liberal women more or less that they had to date and/or marry Conservative men or the institution of marriage would fail in America. That's a huge message to Conservative men that it's the liberal women that are the problem, not them. And it's a message to liberal women **that they have to accept dating men that don't see them as full human beings**, or the sky will fall.",10,kcx6s22
