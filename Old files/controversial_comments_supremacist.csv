While the dominant definition of feminism and original intended definition of feminism is about gender equality, that is not the only working definition. There are and have been female supremacists that have co-opted the term.

I'm not saying this an an incel or anything. From memory the woman who shot Andy Warhol was one. Obviously an unhinged person, not someone to be taken super seriously. But she did write a book about theoretical matriarchal subjugation of men that at least a few people earnestly liked.They're not particularly common, but there absolutely are people who identify as feminists who are not looking for across the board equality.

I mean, look at how fucked over women have been by the patriarchy for centuries. It's not as if there aren't gonna be any women with enough resentment to want to come out on top rather than side by side.

I'd argue these people were bad feminists and shithouse philosophical theorists, but they have been able to hold a claim over the term feminists (mainly by patriarchal media portraying them as far more common than they are as a way to demonise feminism).",6,k9v5jlj

changemyview,17yrbm5,"CMV: People who use the word ""herstory"" are fucking idiots.",63,RealFee1405,k9vylmw,t1_k9vw0pr,Ttoctam,"Yes, but said supremacists still self identify with the feminist moniker and in some cases were directly relevant to feminist movements and have philosophies born from them. And you have to specifically be able to define what a feminist is. It's much better to say someones a shitty feminist than not a feminist.

Let's take for example JKR. Is she a feminist? A lot of what she says and does genuinely hurts a lot of women. But she's given more to women's charities than I'll ever earn in my life. I could never hope to bring the level of money, awareness, discourse, voice, or, support to the cause that she can and has. And I still don't think she's a great feminist and holds some scientifically/socially/anthropologically/historically/medically/philosophically fucked views.

Is JKR definitively not a feminist and what right do we have to define that, and why doesn't she.

I'm a leftsist, and I don't get to pick who else calls themselves that. Hell historically that argument has gotten a lot of people killed. It'd be an act of hubris to think of my view's the objectively correct one. That my version and one else's is leftist. These things are vague socially defined constructs, the idea that we can individually decide what the clear cut definitions are doesn't actually work.",3,k9vw0pr
changemyview,17yrbm5,"CMV: People who use the word ""herstory"" are fucking idiots.",63,RealFee1405,k9vzau0,t1_k9vylmw,DayleD,"There are black supremacists out there who treat the Star of David as a toy and insist they're the only people who are really Jewish.

Extremists often try to latch onto a movement with more legitimacy. It really doesn't matter which one they pick if they don't believe in its precepts.

TERFs are not feminists because they don't want people's opportunities to be unlimited by gender and sex. They want people to be the best versions of their gender stereotypes. If I gave a whole bunch of money for cooking classes for women so that women would be better cooks that would not make me a Feminist.

The lottery gives a whole bunch of its money to women, and it's not Feminist.

Saying we shouldn't talk about social constructs and their boundaries because social constructs have gotten people killed is way off topic but for the record I don't agree with it.",2,k9vylmw

exist.

&#x200B;

In fact early-modern feminist movements (you see, feminist-adjacent movements have existed since the BC era, in various parts of the world) attempted to exclude black women like Sojourner Truth out of fear that women's liberation would become conflated with black liberation, and therefore their mutual enemy, straight white men, would be less inclined to meet feminist demands.

There's something funny that antifeminists do in that while they argue against the existence of a heterosexist white supremacist social reality, they sometimes start pointing out ways in which the feminist movement has been historically heterosexist and white supremacist, but then claim that doesn't prove heterosexist white supremacist social norms exist because - and here's the kicker - women lack the power to force a widescale social norm lol.

&#x200B;

Finally, ""feminism is wrong because the concept of rape exists"" is a sentiment simply - and I mean this with respect - too stupid to engage with seriously, but you should investigate what ancient Grecoroman laws around rape actually looked like. Primarily, they involve theft of property / vandalism, with a woman defined as the property of either her father (if unmarried) or her husband (if married). Moreover, penalties were more severe when someone raped a man, rather than raping a woman.

The **real** criticism of my statement is that I'm applying a modern sociocultural perspective to an ancient historical story that is meant to be broadly metaphorical. Which has an answer too but I think we're done here, right?",3,k9we7ae
