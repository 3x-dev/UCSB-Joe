But it seems that you are trying to mask another narrative within your view, which is that Israel does not share the fault and it is all ultimately Hamas's responsibility. To that view, I would suggest you actually start pulling up all the documented atrocities and crimes of the Israeli occupation, both before and after 10/7 and even in the territories that are under subject to Hamas rule. Just the year before, Israel was responsible for over 200 Palestinian deaths in the West Bank, which is not ruled by Hamas. There are hundreds of civilian casualties to Israeli occupation every single year. That is not to mention the dire and oppressive conditions non-Israeli Palestinians have to endure every year, with no authority to exercise Justice against Israeli violations... hence Hamas! 

Going back to your example:

>But Israel, who is responsible for its own people, would suddenly put them at risk if they attacked the US or someone with superior military might

But what if the US blockaded Israel. build a wall surrounding it, and prevented Israel from accessing it is own energy resources, water supplies, or running as an independent sovereign state? Basically converting Israel into an open-air prison and Israelis into prisoners with no hope for a future? Would Israel still not attack then? Would it just submit to a slow and painful death? and wouldn't you expect Israel to elect a radical government in these conditions?

changemyview,1bbox25,CMV: HAMAS is at fault for the tragedy in Gaza,657,Solidjakes,kuhwa39,t1_kubzqz6,Iseedeadnames,"I need to disagree.

The whole Palestinian identity is a recent concept and even the ""Palestinian"" name is actually a short version of ""Palestinian Arabs"", which opposed to ""Palestinian Jews"" back at the start of the 20th century. The Arabs resettled in the area with the Ottoman conquest, taking nomads from Syria and the Middle East, while the Jews started their migration at the end of the 18th century.

Without taking into account ancient history, which would be silly, we know that in 1939 there were about 600k Jews and 1,3 mil Muslims in Palestine, all of which could trace their heritage at best one century earlier.

There is no proof to claim that Palestinian Arabs had a stronger claim over Palestine than the Jews, which is exactly why the British split their Mandate for Palestine in two and gave each side a part of it, because it was pretty clear that without the British to enforce order the Jews would have been purged out of the area, just as happened in every other MENA country after the departure of the colonialists.

The reason we have this constant war now is because the Islamics could not accept to only have half of the country and immediatly attacked the newborn state of Israel, retaking the Cisjordan. Even the Gaza strip is in the current state not because of Israel conquest, but because Egypt decided to drop it after the Kippur war.

Add to this that Palestinians teach even their children to stab and kidnap Jewish civilians in the streets and you get fully well why they don't deserve another two-state solution - they couldn't even accept the first one and they're only going to make a terrorist state out of whatever land you grant them. Even the PLO claims that the Palestinian state is only a first step for them - they plan to eradicate the Jews altogether from the area.

And in the last twenty years missiles have ALWAYS flew from Gaza toward Israel. Always, with the Palestinian defence force doing nothing to fight or stop Hamas while the PA chose to teach anti-semitic curricula in UNRWA schools. And UNRWA itself bears a lot of responsibility for this situation because we wouldn't have a radicalized population if its officers had actually fixed the school curriculum to democratic standards rather than glorifying the intifadas and enflame hate.

Bottom line, you just can't award this level of violence with a country, it's like saying that wars for conquest are okay to do. And you certainly can't do so to replace the only democratic country in the Middle East with another fundamentalist Islamic state.",33,kubzqz6

1. Name 1 Republican President since Reagan that did what he said he would do. Trump is the first. He halted illegal immigration. He fought hard and eventually won the wall. He cut worthless regulations by the hundreds to thousands. He sent the economy into record territory. He put 3 Constitutionalists on the Supreme Court. He put over 200 conservative judges on Federal benches. He was tough on our supposed allies who have cheated us for decades. He made us energy independent. No new wars. He rebuilt our military. He furthered peace in the Middle East. Tax cuts for the Middle class. And that is just off the top of my head.

2. His policy was extremely effective. Americans are far better off today with what Trump did as President  vs. what Hillary would have done. Unless of course you hate America and what it has always stood for.

3. The world hated him because he was effective. The free rides were ending under Trump. NAFTA cancelled. The Asian Pacific trade agreement under Obama was scrapped completely. It was a disaster for America. He was working on European trade when his 4 years ended. We pay for European socialism. That was going to end, and they knew it. So they hated him. Germany stopped laughing when, as Trump warned them, Russia used natural gas as a weapon, cutting it off. Trump was spot on. His foreign policy was nearly flawless from an American viewpoint. 

4. He knows the rats nest of leftists in the bureaucracy and can counter their treason on day one. Other candidates will try to get along, and will be perpetually undermined by the radicals in high government positions. He already made this mistake,  and it cost him precious time. No one on the Republican side has this experience and can counter it effectively on day one.

The Palestinian resistance movement has a long tradition of non-violent resistance inspired by Gandhian principles.

First off, every place has its share of unthinking assholes, some have more than other places. The correct response is whether it is ever appropriate to punish, oppress or otherwise infringe on the rights of a population in retribution for the words of a few. Or whether words alone can ever justify punishment.
The argument is specious since (some) Israelis are also guilty of indulging in celebrations at the suffering of Palestinians. This started in 1948 with celebrations over the creation of Israel, painfully impervious to the fact that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced to create the new state, and they were prevented by the entire Israeli state apparatus from returning to their homes and property. This is why Palestinians characterize Israel's ""independence"" as the Nakba (catastrophe).

The ire is not reserved for ""Arabs"", far-right rallies in Israel are peppered with [chants](http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.606937)  of [""Death to Leftists"".](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/opinion/how-israel-silences-dissent.html)

Very senior Israeli leaders are also on record as saying and doing vile things, Naftali Bennett has been in the government for years. He's responsible for killing 106 civilians sheltering in a UN facility and [boasts about it](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bennett-under-fire-for-comments-about-killing-Arabs-321467) saying “I have killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there is no problem with that.” Avigdor Lieberman (as Foreign Minister) said Arab citizens of Israel [should be beheaded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/03/10/israeli-foreign-minister-says-disloyal-arabs-should-be-beheaded/). Ayelet Shaked, the current Justice Minister has approvingly quoted statements [describing Palestinian children as ""little snakes""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/07/israels-new-justice-minister-considers-all-palestinians-to-be-the-enemy/). And then you have Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, terrorists both, who set bombs in markets/buses/hotels to kill civilians, who both became Prim Ministers of Israel. And to round out the trinity, we have another Israeli PM, Ariel Sharon, a mass murderer several times over.

> stop lying to children and teaching them to murder Jews, stop naming infants, ""Knife of Jerusalem""

You may see a picture of a Palestinian child holding a gun, or an image of a young boys in a ""Hamas training camp"". This is sometimes followed by ""I dare you to find any other religion that does this"". Sadly, a lot of people are willing to let young children handle lethal weapons. A google image search for ""Israeli toddlers with guns"" will demonstrate that.

Some [militant](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/israeli-terrorists-born-in-the-usa.html) Israelis actively venerate Jewish terrorists, in particular Baruch Goldstein. This includes incidents where children's songs are sung [extolling Baruch Goldstein](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3857671,00.html) or [dressing children as Goldstein, handing them toy rifles and marching them](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8213.html) down the streets of Hebron on Purim. Goldstein killed 29 people praying in Hebron's Ibrahimi mosque on Purim/Ramadan in February 1994.

You may hear the counter-argument that this is just a small minority of [radical](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/31/among-the-settlers) settlers. Yet monuments to terrorists abound in Israel. Numerous streets and parks are named for [Menachem Begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_50_(Israel)), [Yitzhak Shamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_1_(Israel)) and [Ariel Sharon](http://www.jpost.com/Enviro-Tech/Ariel-Sharon-Park-transforms-eyesore-into-paradise), who were all terrorists or mass-murderers. Numerous other streets are named after the [members of the Irgun/Lehi terrorist groups](http://forward.com/opinion/318420/the-problem-with-netanyahus-response-to-jewish-terror/). Some Israelis are well aware of how Palestinians see [such names.](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ex-idf-chief-s-widow-rejects-naming-east-jerusalem-street-after-him-1.5751)

Israel has issued postage stamps for Sharon, Shamir, Begin, and for [Avraham Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Stern), the leader of the Stern Gang (Lehi), whose philosophy was so radical he broke away from Irgun (among other things, he wanted to [ally with Nazi Germany](http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Abraham-Stern-Israels-own-revolutionary-339431) against the British occupation of Palestine). He openly [advocated terrorism](https://books.google.com/books?id=GTtFAV-fIEAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false), yet hundreds of Israelis [flock to his grave](http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-rebel-remembered/) every year and there's a town named for him. Lehi's views towards terrorism were [articulated](https://books.google.com/books?id=I1sXp8D80V0C&lpg=PA182&ots=xx5ArkYbA0&pg=PA182#v=onepage&q&f=false) in their newsletter:

> Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can disqualify terrorism as a means of combat. We are very far from having any moral qualms as far as our national war goes. We have before us the command of the Torah, whose morality surpasses that of any other body of laws in the world: ""Ye shall blot them out to the last man."" But first and foremost, terrorism is for us a part of the political battle being conducted under the present circumstances, and it has a great part to play: speaking in a clear voice to the whole world, as well as to our wretched brethren outside this land, it proclaims our war against the occupier. We are particularly far from this sort of hesitation in regard to an enemy whose moral perversion is admitted by all.

United States also has arguments over symbols. Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer and Andrew Jackson have many places named after them and yet they all engaged in deplorable acts. Many of these monuments deserve to be removed. Yet, this has no bearing on the rights of Americans, and it should not have any bearing on the rights of Palestinians either.

worldnews,3rxvjg,Wave of Violence in Israel and the West Bank,0,WorldNewsMods,cwtb96c,t1_cwt7q81,Seclorum,"> Tel Rumeidah neighborhood near Hebron’s Old City is besieged, completely closed off and isolated – access granted only to so-called “registered residents,” forced to endure intrusive security checks on entering or leaving, discouraging free movement altogether.

I love the quotes they use around the term ""Registered Residents."" If you dont live there, dont fucking go there and start some shit. 

> Some residents refused to submit their names to a security list required for them to enter their own homes freely. Others are denied entry for various intolerable reasons.

Notice how they dont say why the residents wont submit their names. Story of the middle east, ""Buwah... We live there!"" What, is it suddenly against Islam to tell the government your name? 

> Tel Rumeida resembles a ghost town. Visible residents are settlers, many openly displaying guns, protected by heavily armed soldiers in combat gear.

Wait, this is the  same town they were talking about above, with the requirement to actually be a registered resident! And yet they are openly moving about, armed for protection... which flies in the face of earlier statements! 

> Palestinian shops and other businesses were closed, their owners denied access. Draconian measures were imposed on area villages and towns, sealed off like Hebron.

So wait, these are the same people who wont submit their names to get a security pass... this is just another consequence of their recalcitrant behavior. 

> All vehicles leaving the city of Yatta are stopped, contents and passengers intrusively searched, making travel impossible. All youths are suspected “terrorists.”

So just another business as usual checkpoint. Travel is far from impossible. And given the preponderance of youth based violence going on in the entire region, suspecting youth of being terrorists is a fucking sensible precaution. 

> Thousands of Palestinians endure severe disruptions to their daily lives, collectively punished, commonplace Israeli policy – US major media ignoring what’s ongoing entirely, reporting nothing, horrific human rights abuses unnoticed.

And you think the Israeli's arent suffering disruptions too? They have the fucking mongolian horde at their gates stabbing and shooting people daily! 

And why the fuck should Major Media here give a damn? It's a fucking shithole that's only getting worse because of radicalized assholes who go off at the drop of a hat when some Imam somewhere gets a rage boner. 

> Hebron-based Youth Against Settlements (YAS) is an activist group against Israeli colonization of Palestine – “through non-violent popular struggle and civil disobedience,” explaining:

So a group dedicated to opposing any settlements wants to spout their shit. Lets see how this plays out cotton. 

> Ostensibly to protect approximately 600 fundamentalist Israelis that have forcibly established a settlement right in the heart of Hebron, the Israeli state has imposed on the Palestinian residents of the city a regime of forced evictions, curfews, market closures, street closures, military checkpoints, subjection to military law including frequent random searches and detention without charge, and lack of protection from rampant settler violence, which has pressured approximately 13,000 Palestinian civilians to flee their homes in the Hebron city center, turning it into a virtual ghost town.

So in the middle of a bustling city, there just so happens to be a commune of jews living there? Far from a colony. 

And more complaints about how horrible and awful it is the lawful controling power imposes any safety restrictions to prevent civil unrest. Which is terrible for the YAS group who make their living CAUSING unrest. 

And if it's so fucking bad there, and thousands have been fleeing... how many were there to start with? How many are left? 

> The area is surrounded by hostile settlements, Palestinian residents terrorized by harassment, violence, and vandalism, Israeli closed military zones imposed to displace them from their own land – forcing them to leave, preventing their return, confiscating their property and possessions, whatever they can’t take with them.

Again, apparently the entirety of Palestine is surrounded and hemmed in from all sides by billions of evil jews. 

And a lot of the violence that they are terrorized by, is their own fucking people wrecking things. 

And since they are unable to control themselves, it's natural for Israel to bring forces in to maintain law and order. 

> Settlers urge them to kill the Palestinians. “They are rejoicing that they took over my home and building,” Amro explained. “One of the soldiers said that they were (raiding the home) as punishment for speaking to the international media about what’s happening in Hebron.”

Unfounded accusations. 

> Overnight Saturday into early Sunday morning, soldiers kidnapped 18 Hebron area Palestinians, at the same time storming and ransacking homes.

What do you want to bet they were criminals wanted for stabbings? 

Naw, sucker bet. :P 

> On Sunday, Israeli media said Netanyahu will offer Palestinians supposed goodwill gestures when he meets with Obama on Monday, aimed at easing tensions, a shameless ploy to try ending justifiable resistance, another unconditional surrender scheme likely to be denounced and rejected by long-suffering people demanding freedom.

So any attempt to actually finalize a peace treaty with them is thrown to the ground as a shameless ploy eh? 

And you wonder why Israel can justify harsh measures to keep the peace? Because you wont talk to them and you wont negotiate. 

Resistance invites retaliation. Palestine lacks any military capability to compel Israel to surrender or give one inch. It's been 70 years, they need to grow the fuck up. ",23,cwt7q81
